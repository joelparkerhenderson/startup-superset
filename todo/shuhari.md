# Shuhari

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuhari

Shuhari is a Japanese martial art concept which describes stages of learning.

Shuhari translates approximately to "to keep, to fall, to break away":

* shu (守) "protect", "obey". traditional wisdom. learning fundamentals, techniques, heuristics, proverbs.

* ha (破) "detach", "digress". breaking with tradition. detachment from the illusions of self.

* ri (離) "leave", "separate". transcendence. there are no techniques or proverbs, all moves are natural, becoming one with spirit alone without clinging to forms; transcending the physical.

"It is known that, when we learn or train in something, we pass through the stages of shu, ha, and ri. These stages are explained as follows. In shu, we repeat the forms and discipline ourselves so that our bodies absorb the forms that our forebears created. We remain faithful to these forms with no deviation. Next, in the stage of ha, once we have disciplined ourselves to acquire the forms and movements, we make innovations. In this process the forms may be broken and discarded. Finally, in ri, we completely depart from the forms, open the door to creative technique, and arrive in a place where we act in accordance with what our heart/mind desires, unhindered while not overstepping laws." - Aikido master Endō Seishirō shihan.

Martin Fowler writes that the idea is that a person passes through three stages of gaining knowledge:

Shu: In this beginning stage students follow the teachings of one master precisely. They concentrate on how to do the task, without worrying too much about the underlying theory. If there are multiple variations on how to do the task, they concentrate on just the one way their master teaches them.

Ha: At this point students begin to branch out. With the basic practices working they now start to learn the underlying principles and theory behind the technique. They also start learning from other masters and integrates that learning into his practice.

Ri: Now the students aren't learning from other people, but from their own practice. They create their own approaches and adapts what they've learned to their own particular circumstances.

When you teach a concept, tailor your style to the learner, and where they are in shuhari. First, focus the learner on following concrete steps. Second, focus the learner on understanding principles. Third, focus the learner on self-directed innovation.
