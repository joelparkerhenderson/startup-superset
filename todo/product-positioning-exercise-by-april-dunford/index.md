## Product and prospects

**What is your uniqueness?** The things that make you unique are the reason your offering deserves to exist in the first place. You have features that no other solution has. You might have a business model, a set of supply chain relationships, a proprietary process or other intellectual property that you and you alone can deliver. This is what you want to capture.

**What can your uniqueness do for customers?** Customers don’t care about your unique features, they care what those features can do for them. Your positioning needs to be centred on the value that you alone can deliver for customers. At this stage don’t worry too much about which customers might perceive this value.

**Who cares?**: Understanding how to find prospects and prioritize them is the key to maximizing revenue return on your marketing/sales efforts. List the characteristics that you use to identify a good target prospect, and prioritize these. To nail this you have to get specific about which prospects are your best target.


## Market and positioning

**Choose your best market frame of reference**: There are always multiple possible markets, some of which will make your value more obvious than others. You need to choose a market frame of reference that makes your awesomeness completely obvious to your best prospects. 

**How you position**: There are different styles of how you position in a market category. You can try to win an existing market by taking on the leaders head to head, or by splitting off a sub-segment you can own, or by using your unique innovation to change the way people think about the entire market category, or by creating a completely new market category (this is the most difficult option).

**Changing positioning**: A change in positioning is a fundamental change in your business. If you change the market that you operate in, then competitive comparisons shift, your stragetic roadmap shifts, your prospects' expections shift, and so on. Your company needs to internalize these shifts and ensure that everything — marketing, sales, development, business development, support — aligns with the shift.


## Exercise template

**What is it?** One sentence description of what you are. Keep it really short and use plain English words.

**Key Benefit**: This is the single biggest benefit that your target buyers get from your offering. This is the one thing you would talk to customers about if you could only talk about a single benefit.

**Target segment**: Describe the target customers that your are most likely to close in the short term. For B2B startups you will have a description of the target company and the target buyer within that company.

**Market category**: This is the one market category that you compete in. Startups often have a choice of multiple categories; the chosen one will define what the real competitive alternatives will be.

**Competitive alternatives**: What are the solutions that compete with your solution? This should take the customer’s perspective and can include alternatives such as “hire an intern” or “do nothing”.

**Primary differentiation**: This is different from the Key Benefit but often the Key Benefit is derived from this.
