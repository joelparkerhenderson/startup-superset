# System design laws


## Gall's law

Gall's Law states: "A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked. A complex system designed from scratch never works and cannot be patched up to make it work. You have to start over with a working simple system." 

This law is essentially an argument in favour of underspecification: it can be used to explain the success of systems like the World Wide Web and Blogosphere, which grew from simple to complex systems incrementally, and the failure of systems like CORBA, which began with complex specifications. Gall's Law has strong affinities to the practice of agile software development. The law is from the book Systemantics: How Systems Really Work and How They Fail - By John Gall.


## Conway's law

Conway's law states: "organizations which design systems ... are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the communication structures of these organizations."

The law is based on the reasoning that in order for a software module to function, multiple authors must communicate frequently with each other. Therefore, the software interface structure of a system will reflect the social boundaries of the organization(s) that produced it, across which communication is more difficult. Conway's law was intended as a valid sociological observation, although sometimes it's used in a humorous context. The law is named after computer programmer Melvin Conway.


## Deutsch limit

The Deutsch limit states: "The problem with visual programming is that you canâ€™t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time."

This is an aphorism about the information density of visual programming languages originated by L. Peter Deutsch. The primitives in a visual language are the separate graphical elements used to build a program, and having more of them available at the same time allows the programmer to read more information. This limit is sometimes cited as an example of the advantage of textual over visual languages,[4] pointing out the greater information density of text, and posing a difficulty in scaling the language.
