# SPACE: A Framework for Understanding Developer Productivity

## Satisfaction

Satisfaction is how fulfilled workers feel with their work, team, goals, tools, resources, culture, and the like.

• Well-being. How healthy and happy are people?

• Employee satisfaction. The degree of satisfaction among employees, and whether they would recommend their team to others.

• Efficacy. Whether developers have the tools and resources they need to get their work done.

• Burnout. Exhaustion caused by excessive and prolonged workplace stress.


## Performance

Performance is the outcome of a system or process. The performance of individual software developers is sophisticated to quantify, because software is often written by teams, not individuals, and specific code tasks can be complex to tie directly to product outcomes.

• Does the developer's code reliably do what it should?

• Quality. Reliability, absence of bugs, ongoing service health.

• Impact. Customer satisfaction, customer adoption and retention, feature usage, cost reduction.


## Activity

Activity is a count of actions or outputs completed in the course of performing work. Because of the complex and diverse activities that developers perform, their activity is not easy to measure or quantify. 

A well-designed engineering system can help in capturing activity metrics along different phases of the software development life cycle and quantify developer activity at scale. 

Activity that can be quantified relatively easily are:

• Design and coding. Volume or count of design documents and specs, work items, pull requests, commits, and code reviews.

• Continuous integration and deployment. Count of build, test, deployment/release, and infrastructure utilization.

• Operational activity. Count or volume of incidents/issues and distribution based on their severities, on-call participation, and incident mitigation.

These metrics can be used as waypoints to measure some tractable developer activities, but they should never be used in isolation to make decisions about individual or team productivity because of their known limitations. They serve as templates to start with and should be customized based on organizational needs and development environments. As mentioned earlier, many activities that are essential to developing software are intractable (such as attending team meetings, participating in brainstorming, helping other team members when they encounter issues, and providing architectural guidance, to name a few).


## Communication

Communication captures how people and teams collaborate and coordinate.

Effective teams have high transparency, high awareness of team activities and task priorities, and high value outcomes.

Proxies to measure communication, collaboration, and coordination:

• Discoverability of documentation and expertise.

• How quickly work is integrated.

• Quality of reviews of work contributed by team members.

• Network metrics that show who is connected to whom and how.

• Onboarding time for and experience of new members.

 
## Efficiency

Efficiency captures the ability to work with minimal interruptions or delays, whether individually or through a system. This can include how well activities within and across teams are orchestrated and whether continuous progress is being made.

Many developers talk about "getting into the flow" when doing their work, with many books and discussions advising how to achieve flow.

For individual efficiency, set boundaries to get productive and stay productive—for example, by blocking off time for a focus period.

For team efficiency, use value-stream mapping, which diagrams the software development lifecycle from concept to customer. Minimize delays and handoffs. Use the DORA (DevOps Research and Assessment) framework metrics to monitor flow within teams.

Some example metrics to capture the efficiency and flow dimension are:

• Number of handoffs in a process; number of handoffs across different teams in a process.

• Perceived ability to stay in flow and complete work.

• Interruptions: quantity, timing, how spaced, impact on development work and flow.

• Time measures through a system: total time, value-added time, wait time.
