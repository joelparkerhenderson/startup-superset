# Lean startup - definitions


## Minimum viable product (MVP)

Minimum viable product (MVP) is the version of a new product which enables a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. This is similar to a pilot experiment. The goal of an MVP is to test fundamental business hypotheses (or leap-of-faith assumptions) and to help entrepreneurs begin the learning process as quickly as possible.

## Continuous deployment

Continuous deployment is when all code that is written for an application is immediately deployed into production, which results in a reduction of cycle times. Some startups deploy as often as 100 times a day.


## Split test

A split test is an experiment in which different versions of a product are offered to customers at the same time. The goal of a split test is to observe differences in behavior between the two groups and to measure the impact of each version on an actionable metric.


## Actionable metrics

Actionable metrics lead to informed business decisions and subsequent action. Actionable metrics are in contrast to vanity metrics -- measurements that give "the rosiest picture possible" but do not accurately reflect the key drivers of a business.


## Innovation accounting

Innovation accounting focuses on how entrepreneurs can maintain accountability and maximize outcomes by measuring progress, planning milestones, and prioritizing.


## Build-Measure-Learn

The Build–Measure–Learn loop emphasizes speed as a critical ingredient to product development. A team or company's effectiveness is determined by its ability to ideate, quickly build a minimum viable product of that idea, measure its effectiveness in the market, and learn from that experiment.
