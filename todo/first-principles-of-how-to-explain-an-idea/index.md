# First principles of how to explain an idea

Focus on your idea. Separate it from how people will interact with it, and separate the it from how you’ll make it.

2. Labels stick, so give your idea a creative title. This suggestion might meet with resistance, but if you don’t label your idea, then someone else will.

3. Use a logline. In 25 words or less, how can you explain the non-executional bits of your idea? For ideas, read movie promotions-- Hollywood uses loglines. 

4. Show, pause, repeat. Show your idea, then pause, then show people implying, anticipating, or explaining the idea. Repeat keywords through the presentation. 7 repetitions make it stick. 

5. Pause so other people can finish your sentences. A pause lets people integrate your idea with their own mental frameworks. You know you’re onto something when someone else says… “And then you could…” 

6. Set it up. You want your idea to happen, so think about when, where, and for how long you do it. 

8. Care and be confident. Both are contagious. Educate people on how to buy our ideas and to help them feel safe while doing so. Some bravado is sexy but keep your feet on the ground. Avoid condescension and too much ego.

9. Signposts help you get there and get remembered. When you present, remember that your audience has not lived with your thinking. Signposts help you focus and they help the audience process your words. They provide direction and respite.

You can tell the audience: what you’re going to tell them, then how you’re going to tell them, and then tell them what you told them.

Like this: “Today I’m going to show you how we can get 15-year olds to love retirement homes. We need to A, B and C. And here’s how…” And then at the end, repeat these words but using the past tense.

You can use signposts to end a section of the presentation. “Here’s what I said I was going to tell you, here’s why it’s important, here’s what to do about it.”

You can also use article-writing techniques in a presentation. You can use numbers: “3 things you need to know about X.” Numbers tell the brain, “You need to focus on these points now.” They also give importance to the information because they imply you’ve sifted through a lot of thinking to get there. You can use lists - if you dislike lists, relax: everything is list-able. You can use snappy Internet headlines. Whatever works.

10. Make it stick. Play with counter-intuitive headlines as well as “How to” and “Why” setups. Counter-intuitive headlines make people curious. They open a hole through which your ideas can burst. The “How to” and “Why” approaches cut to the chase by saying, “I have the answers for you; you’re in safe hands.”
11. Rehearse. Write your spiel, sharpen it, present it to yourself as you’re walking to work. It needs to feel automatic so that when you’re confronted with the anxiety of sharing it with a room of people, it flows.

12. Apply the blink test. People either get it and want it or or they aren’t and they don’t. Within seconds. Make a fast impact.

13. Plan it analog. Focus on your story dynamics, not your computer. Grab a pencil and some paper and think about how to explain it before you design it.
