## Moore's Law

Moore’s Law states that the performance of computing doubles at the same price roughly every 18 months. This power, in the hands of a great startup team, will breach the advantage of any incumbent or create entirely new categories of breakthrough products. This magical force has animated the technology business for more than 50 years and guarantees that founders will continue to create new digital businesses that are awesome and seem to come out of nowhere.


## Metcalfe’s Law

Metcalfe’s Law states that the value of a network is a function of the square of the number of nodes it contains. Want to know why companies like Facebook are among the most valuable in the world? Look no further than the principles of network theory and the value amplification that comes from harnessing network effects.


## The Power Law

The Power Law states that the largest outcome in a group of companies exceeds the outcomes of all the remaining players in the group combined, and the next largest exceeds the total of the remaining players combined -- and so on.
