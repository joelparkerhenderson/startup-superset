# Habitization vs gamification

For user engagement, there are two broad categories of tactics that are often confused: habitization versus gamification. This page summarizes the key differences.

Habitization:

* Favors external triggers, such as notifications.

* Emphasizes variable rewards, such as seeing more new posts.

* Drives a user to invest in the productâ€™s real improvement, such as inviting friends, or creating more new posts.

* Builds real-world habits, such as reaching friends and sharing ideas.

* Magnifies real-world skills, especially for cooperation, such as for interconnecting friends and ideas.

* Outcomes are positive-sum effects, such as real-world platform growth.

Gamification:

* Favors internal triggers, such as in-game quest activities.

* Emphasizes fixed rewards, such as a number of in-game points.

* Drives a user to pay for in-game values, such as spending time to acquire an in-game badge.

* Builds in-game habits, such as daily grinding for gold coins, or weekly raids for quest points.

* Magnifies in-game skills, especially for competition, such as for leaderboard rankings.

* Outcomes are zero-sum effects, such as in-game winners versus in-game losers.
