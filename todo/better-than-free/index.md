# Better Than Free

<https://kk.org/thetechnium/better-than-fre/>

When copies are free, you need to sell things which can not be copied.

From my study of the network economy I see roughly eight categories of intangible value that we buy when we pay for something that could be free.

In a real sense, these are eight things that are better than free. Eight uncopyable values.  I call them “generatives.” A generative value is a quality or attribute that must be generated, grown, cultivated, nurtured. A generative thing can not be copied, cloned, faked, replicated, counterfeited, or reproduced. It is generated uniquely, in place, over time. In the digital arena, generative qualities add value to free copies, and therefore are something that can be sold.

**Immediacy** – Sooner or later you can find a free copy of whatever you want, but getting a copy delivered to your inbox the moment it is released — or even better, produced — by its creators is a generative asset.

**Personalization** — A generic version of whatever you want may be free, but if you want a specific version that is customized for you, this is a generative asset. Personalization requires an ongoing conversation between the creator and consumer, artist and fan, producer and user. You can’t copy the personalization that a relationship represents. Marketers call that “stickiness” because it means both sides of the relationship are stuck (invested) in this generative asset, and will be reluctant to switch and start over.

**Interpretation** — As the old joke goes: Software is free; the manual is $10,000. A copy of code, being mere bits, is free — and becomes valuable to you only through the support, guidance, and interpretation.

**Authenticity** — You might be able to grab a software application for free, but even if you don’t need a manual, you might like to be sure it is bug free, reliable, warranted, and comes from the original creators.

**Accessibility** – Ownership often sucks. Many people will be happy to have others tend our “possessions” by subscribing to them, backing them up, adding to tem, and organizing them.

**Embodiment** — At its core the digital copy is without a body. You can take a free copy of a work and throw it on a screen. But perhaps you’d like to see it in hi-res on a huge screen? Or printed on paper and bound in leather.  The music is free; the bodily performance expensive. This formula is quickly becoming a common one for not only musicians, but even authors. The book is free; the bodily talk is expensive.

**Patronage** — It is my belief that audiences WANT to pay creators. Fans like to reward artists, musicians, authors and the like with the tokens of their appreciation, because it allows them to connect. 

**Findability** — Where as the previous generative qualities reside within creative digital works, findability is an asset that occurs at a higher level in the aggregate of many works. When millions of everything are requesting our attention, being findable is valuable.
