<b>Keep the lights on, and keep making them cheaper.</b> Everything your team already owns (that actually matters to your customers) needs to approach zero maintenance costs. Designate a lead to actively seek out and reduce the highest maintenance burdens on your team. This work is arguably more important than any new features - make sure you message it that way. It’s glorious work, because that lead is maintaining something that is already valuable today. This looks like e.g. writing docs for users to self-serve, fixing flaky bugs, and adding preproduction tests to catch things that cause outages.

<b>Cut the entire roadmap of new work down to one thing at a time.</b> List all the new things you’re currently doing or planning to do. Prioritize the list. Drop everything except the top item. Don’t like the result? Don’t think of it as choosing a bunch of critical things to fail. Think of it as choosing one critical thing to actually succeed at. You now have a list you can share with people on your team and elsewhere, to explain what’s going on. People that care about business impact will be solidly behind delivering a single good, long-term useful feature. Your team will gain a coherent focus.

<b>Say "No" early and often.</b> As soon as you hear anybody else’s plans that involve your team doing something new, interject with a clear "No". Interrupt the conversation and tell them their plan is going to fail if it depends on your work. Saying “we’ll do this later” is not enough - you have to show all the things that come in front of their ask, and tell them they aren’t getting what they want, when they want it. If someone isn’t at least a little disappointed, they didn’t hear no. Keep saying it now and in the future.

<b>Suggestions to say "No".</b> I agree this sounds like a really useful feature. Right now our priority is MAIN_PRIORITY because of ONE_SENTENCE_JUSTIFICATION. Once we finish MAIN_PRIORITY, should we consider dropping SECOND_PRIORITY and do it? We estimate this feature will take ESTIMATE. How will this feature affect our shipping of MAIN_PRIORITY? I think we can finish MAIN_PRIORITY without this. 

<b>It's not done until it's done.</b> Declaring a feature that’s in customers’ hands “done,” without monitoring, or with flaky tests, or tons of highly redundant code, or other obvious pending work, doesn’t magically get that work done. That work will always be there. It’ll just show up as surprises in your Maintenance Roadmap at an unknown date, when your team has mentally moved on and stopped thinking about the feature.
