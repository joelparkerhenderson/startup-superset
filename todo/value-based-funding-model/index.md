Value-based funding models make the shift away from “funding” projects with comprehensive execution plans, well defined scope, and detailed ROI calculations, to one of placing “bets” on corporate strategies and investments in outcomes. 

Six essential conditions:

1. Adopting a venture capital mindset

2. Focusing on funding allocation, not budgeting

3. Leveraging leading indicators to decide whether to pivot an initiative, or double-down on it, or kill it

4. Allocating funding based on value toward strategic goals, not available capacity

5. Changing a value stream at a time

6. Funding innovation intentionally




- Break down big strategic goals into actionable experiments that can be validated with real customer data. 

- When experiments show promise, then increase funding incrementally. 

- Do the experiments with time-boxing, and with rigor, and structure them to reduce the risk of going in the wrong direction. 

- Initiatives must demonstrate value delivered, and the promise of future value, in order for funding to continue. 

- Validating an idea doesn’t have to use working code. For example, testing a partnership hypothesis could involve exploring partnership models in early conversations to validate leap of faith assumptions. 


- New ideas don't have to be fully developed, instead they can be funded as experiments to conduct customer research, develop a prototype or test the idea to validate the hypotheses of value. 

- What's valuable is your people adopting a venture capital mindset, not the process itself.   

- Create a mechanism for senior leadership to place bets on the most promising initiatives, and the most promosing experiments to try.

- Use proactive decentralized data-driven incremental decisions to reduce the risk of large program failures, and to keep investment focused on business value.
