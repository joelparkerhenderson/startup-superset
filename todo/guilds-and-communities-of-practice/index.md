# Guilds and communities of practice

Objective:

1. Create ways to share knowledge.

2. Work together on challenges within specific practice areas.  

3. Describe ideas we're trying that may also help more groups.


Our projects tend toward multidisciplinary teams:

1. A great way to focus people on a specific outcome.

2. A great way to increase interactions among practices.

3. But-- tends to silo each team's practice area.


How can we help a practice areas across teams?

1. We tried ad-hoc calls yet had minimal success.

2. We tried project tools yet missed a community feeling.

3. We asked peers and learned about the "Guild" concept.


What's a guild?

1. A guild is a fun name for a community of practice (COP).

2. A guild fosters interactions, collaboration, and community.

3. A guild and COP can be multi-organizational -- ideas wanted! :)


Our IT guild is trying ideas as "building blocks":

1. Demos: easy sample code, starter kit apps, etc.

2. Services: data visualizion, security authentication, etc.

3. Infrastructure: cloud hosting, database administration, etc.
