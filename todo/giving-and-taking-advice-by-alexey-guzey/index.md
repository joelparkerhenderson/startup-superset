# Giving and taking advice by Alexey Guzey

Giving good advice is both incredibly easy and incredibly difficult. It’s usually helpful to note the motivation, personality, personal circumstances, etc. of the person on the other end of the conversation, and to give both of you enough time to figure out what’s really going on. And yet, sometimes “just do x” is the best advice you could give and sometimes hearing “just do x” is the best advice you can hear.

<b>Start simple:</b> Advice works when it makes you think and explain. It often takes the form of questions or general suggestions/pointers. For example, “what’s your plan for doing X?” or “what was the original reasoning for doing X?” are often actually very helpful. Simple advice can nudge people in the right direction, and help them remember what's needed.

<b>Try the obvious:</b> Our brains are basically undercooked sausages. It’s terrifying how easy it is to forget to do obvious things. Advice often cashes out to some form of “have you considered doing the obvious thing?”. Try “What could make this easier?” or “What about alternatives?” or “Have you considered delegating this?” and so on.

<b>Alignment:<b> Make sure that the person’s traits, capabilties, and ambitions match the advice. We are all different people, and differ in levels of conscientiousness, extraversion, energy, ambition, curiosity, independence, risk-seeking, fame-seeking, neuroticism, conflict-aversion, obsessiveness, what we care about, psychological blocks, etc.

<b>Causation:</b> People are systematically wrong about their own traits, desires, and emotions. People will give you systematically bad advice if they reason from wrong explanations from their behavior. Make sure the advice is not mistaking correlation for causation.

<b>Reversion:</b> When things go bad, then we try to fix them, but the truth is quite often things return to normal all on their own, or due to external factors. Realize it may not be our actions that made things better.

<b>Bias:</b> Avice we are given is systematically biased because people are bad at figuring out how stuff works, and also because advice can’t be isolated away from the relationships we have. 

<b>Safety bias:</b> Advice you receive will be systematically biased in favor of safe choices. One way out of this is to explicitly ask something along the lines of “what’s the most outrageous advice you can come up with? what advice are you scared of giving me because you think I’ll blame you if it fails?" and to remember to try to figure out why they believe the things they tell you, why the made the decisions they made, and why they tell you these specific things whenever someone shares advice with you.

<b>Selection bias:</b> Remember that most people only did 1 or 2 things in their life. The probability that one of them is exactly what you should be doing with your life is very low, and they probably know next to nothing about everything else.

<b>Hidden disfunction:</b> The simpler the problem seems, the more difficult it may be to fix. Don't make the mistake of thinking “this just needs a quick fix!” instead of “what level of hidden dysfunction is keeping even this simple problem unsolved?”

<b>Change is hard and worth trying:</b> Simply grafting change onto anyone’s life is unlikely to work. Change is actually pretty hard because the structure of systems is typically very path-dependent, driven by personal exploration, and working largely because of emotional attachment. Change is worth trying, but it’s not easy to do, and you should not be discouraged that it doesn’t work 100% instantaneously.
