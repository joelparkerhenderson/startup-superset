## The most important two rules

* Don't tell them about your new idea.

* Ask at least one question that has the potential to destroy your idea.


## Questions to ask any time

* Could you tell me about a recent time that happened?

* What is going well with that? What could be improved?

* Is there anything else I should be asking?

* Who else should I talk to about this?


## Questions to validate a proble

* Can you show me how you solve the problem?

* What do you love and hate about it?

* What are you using now, such as for tools, approaches, and processes?

* How did they find out about the current solution?

* How much do you pay for it?

* What happens if you fail to solve the problem?


## Questions if a person suggests a feature

* Can you tell me more about why you want that?

* What would that let you do?

* How are you coping today without that?

* How does that rank in comparison to other things you want?


## Questions to avoid

* Do you think itâ€™s a good idea?

* Would you buy this product?

* How much would you pay for it?

* Would you pay X for a product that did this?
