# Move Fast + Total Ownership Culture

https://blog.southparkcommons.com/move-fast-or-die/

Facebook famously creates a culture that moves fast and breaks things. When you are racing against the clock of funding and competition, you want a very rapid product cycle. Here’s how we did it at Facebook.

These practices below are all part of what I call a Total Ownership Culture. Everyone must feel empowered to fix anything while safeguarding the system from descent into chaos. Easy to say. Hard to do.

1. Indoctrinate speed for every new employee. All new hires are required to get their dev environment setup on Day 1 and have a commit released to all users on Day 2. The takeaway for new hires was clear: "Holy smokes, this moves fast".

2. Celebrate the first time someone breaks something. This is a public right-of-passage, like sending out a congratulatory email to all of engineering. It is important to remove any shame associated with breakage. Speed necessarily entails mistakes. The only unforgivable mistake was delay.

3. Embrace asking for forgiveness, never for permission. Let anyone touch any part of the codebase and get in there to fix a bug or build a feature. Yes, this can cause bugs. Yes, that is an acceptable tradeoff. There are never any recriminations about who introduces a bug— just how heroic the are as part of the fixing team. 

4. Celebrate and promote our most prolific engineers— not the ones who solved the hardest or most interesting problems. The organization pays a lot of attention to who you choose to recognize publicly. The relative values of quantity (aka speed) and quality are different for startups. You can shift what a team prioritizes with what you reward.

5. Invest a lot in the ability to recover quickly from failures. This takes the form of testing (Chaos Monkey), process (Incident Response Review), NOC centers (for constant monitoring) and tooling in general. Accept that mistakes are going to be made. It is vital that you recover as quickly as possible.
