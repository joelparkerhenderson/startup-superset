**Own your onboarding.** Treat your onboarding like any other project you’re tasked to lead. Clarify expectations early and often. Define your 100-day plan. Seek feedback in week one. Revisit expectations. Request clarifications. Ask for help. Make relationships work.

**Have a Beginner’s mind.** Adjust to the unique circumstances of the team and org. Ask questions. Don’t just stick to what you know. Don’t be the person that comes in with “the answer”. Respect what exists. Appreciate the value of working systems and the lessons they embody.

**Invest time in culture and relationships.**  Spend time with your boss and direct reports, and with peers and stakeholders. Understand how discussions are conducted and how conflict is resolved. Engage with the voice of the customer and the systems old hand.

**Write your 100-day plan.** Set goals for learning (e.g. what practices to use), relationships (e.g. which people to engage), and deliverables (e.g. what results to ship). Get feedback from your manager, ideally within the first week. Identify gaps in your plan and update it.

**Ship early.** This is a forcing function to help you (i) learn enough about existing systems to deliver a result soon,(ii) start earning your team's trust. Examples: merge a pull request, create an experiment, write a design document. Demo to the team and get feedback.

**Improve onboarding for the next person.** One of the highest leverage things you can do is to improve the onboarding process so future joiners become more productive faster. Can you share any help for newcomers, such as your pain points and solutions?
