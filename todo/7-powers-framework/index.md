The 7 Powers Framework shows how to intentionally craft persistent & durable differential returns. The framework is by Stanford professor Hamilton Helmer. “Power” in this context is the underlying mechanism that makes your company defensible.

1. Network Effects: The value of a service to each user increases as new users join the network.

2. Cornered Resource: A business that leverages a cornered resource has preferential access at attractive terms to a coveted asset that can independently enhance value.

3. Scale Economies: A business in which per unit cost declines as production volume increases.

4. Switching Costs: Stickiness of your product can protect you from the forces of competition if it locks your customers in.

5. Counter Positioning: A newcomer adopts a new, superior business model which the incumbent does not mimic due to anticipated damage to their existing business.

6. Brand: The durable attribution of higher value to an objectively identical offering that arises from historic info about the seller.

7. Process Power: Embedded company organization and activity sets which enable lower costs and/or a superior product.

## Notes

Getting to a position of power is a creative act. You’re figuring out something that hasn’t been figured out before.

You don’t get these powers overnight. You usually don’t get them accidentally. It is a long period of focusing, repetition, and culture in a lot of the cases too, to achieve these powers.

The overall types of power are simple. But the the specific instantiations of them for each company are incredibly complicated. As a business person, you ask yourself, how can I create these powers? You look at what’s coming at you over time. This is a hard thing to do. It’s very different than product-market fit. You have to think in a different way. Your strategy evolves over time as you are responsive to markets and as customers develop.
