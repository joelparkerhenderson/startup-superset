The main idea is that governance— public or corporate— is driven by the self-interested effort of leaders to acquire and keep their power.

Under this lens, all policy decisions are a play for the loyalty of key backers, whether it’s the inner circle in a dictatorship or a whole populace in a democracy.

**Selectorate Theory**

The difference in the relative size of these groups determines how much a leader can get away with and what the quality of life is like for those at the bottom of the system.

**The Nominal Selectorate**. Interchangeables. These people have a small voice in choosing the leader. This is the pool of potential supporters. Example: Millions of individual voters, or small shareholders.

**The Real Selectorate**. Influentials. These people actually choose the leader. Example: Senior members of the political parties, or big institutional shareholders.

**The Winning Coalition**. Essentials. These people's support is critical both to gaining the leadership and to keeping it. Example: A handful of board members and senior management.

Five rules to keep a hold on power in any system:

**1. Keep your “Winning Coalition” as small as possible.**

The smaller the symbiotic group of people beholden to you, the more efficient it is to retain leadership through giving private benefits.

**2. Keep your “Nominal Selectorate” as large as possible.**

You’ll want to keep your inner circle on its toes by having many people waiting in the wings to replace them. You also want a large tax base to draw from.

**3. Control the flow of revenue.**

State bankruptcy is a political crisis. It either means the leader cannot purchase political loyalty from key backers or, in a democracy, cannot afford pork-barrel projects to buy popularity.

**4. Pay your key supporters just enough to keep them loyal.**

And make sure you’re the only one with access to the treasury.

**5. Don’t take money out of your supporters’ pockets to make the people’s lives better.**

Starving illiterates don’t make good revolutionaries, whereas dissatisfied cronies can oust you.

As long as the leader offers more benefits to his essentials than they could expect from alternate leadership, the incumbent enjoys a large advantage,

Your inner circle may include very few of the people who brought you to power in the first place. Your fellow revolutionaries may be too much in the habit of revolution to be safe colleagues going forward.

Appeals to ideological principles and rights are generally a cover. J.P. Morgan had it right: There is always some principled way to defend any position, especially one’s own interests.
