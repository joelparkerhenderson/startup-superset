This essentially equates to your Quality of Character & the Quality of the Deal.

You need to ask yourself how much leverage do you have from the above categories. You need to craft your pitch around showcasing and demonstrating critical aspects of the above outline.

What you focus on depends on the individual investor or firm you are pitching to. They each value the above differently--some care about stuff not on that list.
