# North Star Framework 

The North Star Framework is a model for managing products. Think of your company as a value-creation system, then identify the top handful of things that impact the flow of value-creation work.

The North Star Metric is a metric that you decide best represents your product strategy, that connects customer value to sustainable business results, and that you believe is a leading indicator of success.

The North Star Inputs are a small set (3-6) of influential complementary factors that you believe most directly affect the North Star Metric, and that you believe you can influence through your product offering.

The Metric and Inputs must cover both your product’s current state (such as market, functionality, and performance) and potential future state, and must be easy to explain to your teams.

How to leverage the Metric and Inputs: 

1. Focus on impact via sustainable business growth. 

2. Improve teamwork, communication, and collaboration. 

3. Prioritize and accelerate informed decentralized decision-making. 

4. Improve tasks of research, design, development, and delivery.

Your metric must be:

* A leading indicator: it predicts future success.

* Easy to understand: it uses plain language and makes sense.

* SMART: specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, timely.

Team benefits:

* Team members can explain how their day-to-day work connects to the North Star.

* More collaboration thanks to improved alignment and shared strategic purpose.

* The “battle of ideas” shifts from intuitions to experiments and evidence.

Roadmap tips:

* Emphasize the roadmap connections with the North Star Metric and Inputs.

* Prioritize the roadmap opportunities most likely to drive Inputs.

* Always follow up on roadmap results to assess their impact on the Metric.
