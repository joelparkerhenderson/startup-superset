# Amazon Principal Engineering Tenets

Exemplary Practitioner - Principal Engineers are hands-on and lead by example. We deliver artifacts that set the standard for engineering excellence, from designs to algorithms to implementations. Only by being close to the details can we earn the respect needed to be effective technical leaders.

Technically Fearless - Our company's startup culture does not admit the luxury of conservatism. Principal Engineers tackle intrinsically hard problems, venturing beyond comfortable approaches when necessary. We acquire expertise as needed, pioneer new spaces, and inspire others as to what’s possible.

Balanced and Pragmatic - Principal Engineers are pragmatic problem solvers. We apply judgment and experience to balance trade-offs between competing interests. We simplify processes and technologies while advocating a long-term view.

Illuminate and Clarify - Principal Engineers bring clarity to complexity and demonstrate smart ways to simplify. We frame each problem in its customer and business context and boil it down to its essence. We probe assumptions, illuminate pitfalls, and foster shared understanding. We accelerate progress by driving crisp and timely decisions.

Flexible in Approach - Principal Engineers adapt our approach to meet the needs of the team, project, and product. We solicit differing views and are willing to change our minds as we learn more. We recognize there are often many viable solutions, and that sometimes the best solution is to solve a different problem, or to not solve the problem at all.

Respect What Came Before - Principal Engineers are grateful to our predecessors. We appreciate the value of working systems and the lessons they embody. We understand that many problems are not essentially new.

Learn, Educate, and Advocate - Principal Engineers are constantly learning. We seek technical knowledge and educate the entire organization about trends, technologies, and approaches. We combine vision and discretion to drive fruitful and even game-changing technology choices.

Have Resounding Impact - “Deliver Results” is a low bar for a Principal Engineer. Without seeking the spotlight, Principal Engineers make a lasting impact that echoes through the technology, the product, and the company. We amplify our impact by aligning teams toward coherent architectural strategies.
