# Jobs, pains, gains

Great problems arenâ€™t found sitting in the office. You have to get out. 

When you talk with users, try this simple framing: jobs, pains, and gains.

<b>Jobs</b> are what your customers need to accomplish, such as specific tasks or needs they want to satisfy.

<b>Pains</b> are what your customers want to avoid, such as risk, negative emotions, or costs.

<b>Gains</b> are positive outcomes your customers are hoping for, such as functional utility, positive emotions, or even cost savings.

Users know their jobs, pains, and gains. Users won't know an ideal solution, product, feature set, or development roadmap.

Go into the field to observe users. Ask the user how they handle the problem. Ask for specifics. You are trying find users who invest their time and energy into the problem, and the significant nuggets of knowledge those users have come up with.
