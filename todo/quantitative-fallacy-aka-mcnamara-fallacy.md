# Quantitative fallacy a.k.a. McNamara fallacy

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McNamara_fallacy

The quantitative fallacy describes making a decision based solely on quantitative observations (such as metrics) while ignoring qualitative observations (such as sentiments) and all else (such as intuitions). The reason given is that qualitative observations can be proven, while other observations cannot be proven.

"The first step is to measure whatever can be easily measured. This is OK as far as it goes. The second step is to disregard that which can't be easily measured or to give it an arbitrary quantitative value. This is artificial and misleading. The third step is to presume that what can't be measured easily really isn't important. This is blindness. The fourth step is to say that what can't be easily measured really doesn't exist. This is suicide."
 — Daniel Yankelovich, "Corporate Priorities: A continuing study of the new demands on business" (1972).

The fallacy is named for Robert McNamara, the US Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1968. The fallacy refers to McNamara's belief as to what led the United States to defeat in the Vietnam War—specifically, his quantification of success in the war (e.g. enemy body count), ignoring other variables.
