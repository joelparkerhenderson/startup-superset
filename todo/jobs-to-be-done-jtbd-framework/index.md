# Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) framework

[Build Products That Solve Real Problems With This Lightweight JTBD Framework](https://firstround.com/review/build-products-that-solve-real-problems-with-this-lightweight-jtbd-framework/)

Jobs To Be Done (JTBD) is a thought process that emphasizes what a person aims to accomplish, and how the person does it. JTBD is an approach for product management, user interaction, software innovation, company marketing, and more.

Template:

* When I… (contexts, circumstances, triggers, etc.)

* But… (barriers, struggles, missing steps, etc.)

* Help me… (goals, tasks, motivations, etc.)

* In order to… (outcomes, purposes, values, etc.)

Guidelines:

* Jobs describe underlying human needs, not product features.

* Jobs illuminate consumer insights on underlying motivations and struggles, not business objectives.

* Jobs highlight a promising specific market opportunity about an unmet need — something that some people want very much.

Great JTBD statements do three things: 

* Create absolute clarity: about the user's contexts, barriers, goals, and outcomes.

* Highlight how to work: focus on customer development, product development, and market development. 

* Improve chance of success: by honing targets, by accelerating product-market fit work, by leveraging alternatives or substitutes, and by deliving real value solving real problems.
