Marc Benioff, CEO of Saleforce, writes: Success depends on constant communication and complete alignment. We've been able to achieve both with the help of a management process I developed a number of years ago called the V2MOM, which stands for: Vision, Values, Methods, Obstacles, and Measures. V2MOM powers the way we run our business, allows us to define our goals, enables us to organize a principled way to execute them, and takes into consideration our constant drive to evolve.

Vision:

* What do you want to accomplish? (Keep it to 1-3 sentences)
* What impact will it have on your company, employees, customers, and community?
* How can you make it inspiring, or engaging, or motivating, or fun, or creative?

Values:

* What are your most important principles and beliefs, relevant to you achieving your vision?
* How can you describe the values so everyone involved is clear on what it means to live them?
* How will the values guide your team's everyday decisions, priorities, and tradeoffs?

Methods:

* What actions and steps that your team needs to take in order to achieve your vision?
* What is your prioritization of your methods, in importance, and also in timeline order?
* What specifically can your team do to help the methods be successful, and also improve them?

Obstacles: 

* What challenges, problems, issues, risks, and more, does your team have to overcome?
* What is critical, and what do you need to be mindful of, in order to overcome the obstacles?
* What specifically can your team do to help tackle the obstacles, and also overcome them?

Measures: 

* How do you know when you're succeeding? (Focus on significant outcomes, not day-to-day)
* How are the measures SMART (Specific, Measurable, Actionable, Relevant, Timely)?
* What specifically can your team do to leverage measures, and also evolve them?
