A two-way writeup starts with a clear idea, similar to an Amazon six-page memo, then creates a structured interactive conversation. The writeup guides reviewers giving actionable feedback. They create an inclusive environment by enabling anyone to clearly state their sentiment and ask questions that others can upvote. The writeups are more efficient and effective at moving a team toward a goal.

A two-way writeup treats a writeup as a conversation toward progress. A two-way writeup emphasizes questions and feedback as a core aspect of iteration toward a solution. 


**Done Reading**: Ask each reader to mark when they're done reading. For example, add a reaction button or checkbox at the bottom of your writeup. For long writeups, add a reaction button or checkbox per major section, in order to encourage engagement along the way. When you know the team done reading, then you start the discussion. 

**Ask Questions**: Ask readers specific questions that you need answered to make progress. It can be simple such as "How do you feel about the proposal?" or targeted like "What are specific metrics for this?" or generative such as "What isn't here that we should add?"

**Select Questions**: Select the most important questions-- ideally the questions that provide answers to other downstream questions. They’re called Eigenquestions. Providing a way to enumerate questions and vote on the most important ones to discuss. We use a table of questions called ‘Dory’; it’s named after the fish in Finding Nemo that asks all the questions :)

Group questions in order to prioritize the discussion. When you see questions that are variants on a theme, the writeup author can add a new select-list column for "group"" or "theme" or "category" etc. They will then quickly go through and categorize the questions. Categorizing the questions will enable them to "Group" the new column so that it’s easy to go through categories or themes of questions.

Select Eigenquestions. An Eigenquestion is a highly important question that helps answer other questions; the name is a play on the word Eigenvalue. Early in a lifecycle, a team may still be searching for the Eigenquestions. In this case, it can help to add another ‘Reaction’ column and ask the audience to vote on which questions they think are Eigenquestions. Sometimes, you’ll get critical mass on one question that feels like it should be answered. And other times, it will generate a good discussion on how we don’t quite have the right question to answer yet.
