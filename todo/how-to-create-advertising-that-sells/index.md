# How to Create Advertising that Sells - By David Ogilvy

How do you position your product? Decide this before advertising. Research  helps; look before you leap.

What is the big idea? It takes a BIG IDEA to make a person notice your advertising, remember it, and take action. 

What do you promise? A promise is a benefit for the consumer, and should be unique and competitive; a promise is not a claim, theme, or slogan.

How does your advertising contribute to the complex symbol which is your brand? Build a sharply-defined personality for your brand.

Involve the customer. Talk to her. Charm her. Make her hungry. Get her to participate.

Innovate. Start trends instead of following them. This is risky so pre-test  with consumers.

Make the product the hero of your advertising. Successful advertising sells the product without drawing attention to itself.

Leverage demographic segements and also psychological segments, such as nonconformists versus status-seekers.

Genuine news works. It is easier to interest the consumer in a product when it is new than at any other point in its life. 

Craft your strategy to one simple promise, and go the whole hog in delivering that promise. Don't attempt too many things.

Testimonial ads work. Make them credible and use people who are relevant and naturally connected to your product.

Problem-solution ads work. Set up a problem that the consumer recognizes, then show how your product can solve that problem, then prove the solution.

Visualize your promise. It saves time. It drives the promise home. It is memorable.

Slice of life playlets are corny, and most ad creators detest them, but they sell well.

Make your pictures tell the story. What you show is more important than what you say.

On-camera voices do significantly better than off-camera voice-overs.

Musical backgrounds reduce recall.

The stand-up pitch can be effective, if it is delivered with straightforward honesty.

Give a flourish of singularity that will stick in the consumer's mind. One such burr is the MNEMONIC DEVICE, or relevant symbol.

Animations & cartoons are good for children, but less persuasive for adults. A consumer cannot identify herself with the character in the cartoon. Cartoons do not invite belief.

Salvage commercials. Many commercials which test poorly can be salvaged by rework or re-editing.

Factual commercials tend to be more effective than emotional commercials.

Commercials that begin with an exciting opening hold their audience at a higher level than commercials which begin quietly.

Emphasize headlines. On the average, five times as many people read the headline as read the body. Use simple language. Include the brand name, the promise, ideally genuine new information. Headlines of 8-10 words are most effective for recall. Headlines of 10+ words sell more.

Use captions to sell. On the average, two times as many people read the captions as read the body copy. Each caption should be a miniature ad for the product, complete with brand name and promise.

Select your prospects. When you advertise a product which is consumed only by a special group, it pays to highlight that group in your headline. 

People read long copy. Readership falls off rapidly up to 50 words, but drops very little between 50-500 words. The more you tell, the more you sell.

Photographs can have "story appeal". When a consuler sees the photograph, he asks himself "What goes on here?", then reads the copy to find out.

Before-and-after advertisements are somewhat above average in attention value. Any form of "visualized contrast" seems to work well.

Photographs work better than drawings. Photos attract more readers, are more believable, are better remembered, and sell more merchandise.

Editorial layouts get higher readership than conventional advertisements.

Repeat your winners. Readership can actually increase with repetition.
