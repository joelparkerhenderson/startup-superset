# Measurement anti-patterns

**Don't focus on measurement when the bigger issue is a lack of trust.** Sometimes you’ll find yourself in a measurement loop. The CEO asks you to provide engineering metrics, you provide those metrics. Instead of seeming satisfied, the CEO asks for another, different set of metrics. Often the underlying issue here is a lack of trust. While metrics can support building trust, they are rarely enough on their own. Instead, push the CEO (or whoever remains frustrated despite bringing more metrics) on their frustration, until you get to the bottom of the concern masquerading as a need for metrics

**Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good.** Many measurement projects never make progress because the best options require data that you don’t have. Instrumenting that data gets onto the roadmap, but doesn’t quite get prioritized. A year later, you’re not measuring anything. Instead, push forward with anything reasonable, even if it’s flawed.

**Don't use optimization metrics to judge performance.** It’s easy to be tempted to use your optimization metrics to judge individual or team performance. For example, if a team is generating far fewer pull requests than other teams their size, it’s easy to judge that team as less productive. That may be true, but it certainly might not. Instead, evaluate teams on based on their planning or operational metrics.

**Don't measure individuals rather than teams.** Writing and operating software is a team activity, and while one engineer might be focused on writing code this sprint, another might be focused on being glue to make it possible for the first engineer to focus. Looking at individual data can be useful for diagnostic purposes, but it’s a poor tool for measuring performance. Instead, focus on measuring organization and team-level data. If something seems off, then consider digging into individual data to diagnose, but not to directly evaluate

**Don't worry too much about measurements being misused.** Many leaders are concerned that their CEO or Board will misuse data. For example, they might throw a fit that many engineers are only releasing code twice a week: it’s that a sign that the engineers are lazy? Recognize that these lines of discussion are very frustrating, but also that avoiding it doesn’t fix them! Instead, take the time to educate stakeholders who are interpreting data in unconstructive ways. Keep an open mind, there is always something to learn, even if a particular interpretation is in error

**Don't deciding measures alone rather than in community.** I do recommend coming to measurement with a clear point of view on what you’ve seen work well, but that should absolutely be coupled with multiple rounds of feedback and iteration. Particularly when you’re new to a company, it’s easy to project your understanding of your last job onto the new one, which erodes trust. Instead, build trust by incorporating feedback from your team and peers
