# The Innovators Dilemma + disruptive innovation

"The Innovator's Dilemma: When New Technologies Cause Great Firms to Fail" is a business book. It demonstrates how successful, outstanding companies can do everything "right" and yet still lose their market leadership – or even fail – as new, unexpected competitors rise and take over the market. There are two key parts to this dilemma.

  * Value to innovation is an S-curve: Improving a product takes time and many iterations. The first of these iterations provide minimal value to the customer but in time the base is created and the value increases exponentially. Once the base is created then each iteration is drastically better than the last. At some point the most valuable improvements are complete and the value per iteration is minimal again. So in the middle is the most value, at the beginning and end the value is minimal.

  * Incumbent sized deals: The incumbent has the luxury of a huge customer set but high expectations of yearly sales. New entry next generation products find niches away from the incumbent customer set to build the new product. The new entry companies do not require the yearly sales of the incumbent and thus have more time to focus and innovate on this smaller venture.

The book introduces the seminal theory of "disruptive innovation" that has changed the way managers and CEOs around the world think about innovation. 

The book argues that the following are common principles that incumbents must address:

  * Resource dependence: Current customers drive a company's use of resources.

  * Small markets struggle to impact an incumbent's large market.

  * Disruptive technologies have fluid futures, as in, it is impossible to know what they will disrupt once matured.

  * Incumbent Organizations' value is more than simply their workers, it includes their processes and core capabilities which drive their efforts.

  * Technology supply may not equal market demand. The attributes that make disruptive technologies unattractive in established markets often are the very ones that consisted their greatest value in emerging markets.

The book argues that the following strategies assist incumbents in succeeding against the disruptive technology:

  * They develop the disruptive technology with the 'right' customers. Not necessarily their current customer set.

  * They place the disruptive technology into an autonomous organization that can be rewarded with small wins and small customer sets.

  * They fail early and often to find the correct disruptive technology.

  * They allow the disruption organization to utilize all of the company's resources when needed but are careful to make sure the processes and values were not those of the company.
