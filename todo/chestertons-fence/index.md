Chesterton's fence is the principle that you should wait to make reforms until you understand the existing state and the reasoning behind it. 

Chesterton wrote: In the matter of reforming things, as distinct from deforming them, there is one plain and simple principle; a principle which will probably be called a paradox. There exists in such a case a certain institution or law; let us say, for the sake of simplicity, a fence or gate erected across a road. The more modern type of reformer goes gaily up to it and says, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear it away.' To which the more intelligent type of reformer will do well to answer: 'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't let you clear it away. Go away and think. Then, when you can come back and tell me that you do see the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it.'

How many times have you looked at a system, a piece of code, a business process, and thought "Why on earth was it done this way?‚Äù. Some reasons are not initially obvious. Maybe the authors tried things different ways and discovered usability issues. Maybe there were legal compliance restrictions. Maybe there were interoperability requirments. Maybe there were tradeoff decisions made due to time pressure. Once you know the why and how, then you can make better decisions.
