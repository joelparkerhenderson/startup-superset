# Joel's Totally Fair Method to Divide Up The Ownership of Any Startup

The most important principle: fairness, and the perception of fairness, is much more valuable than owning a large stake.

As your company grows, you tend to add people in "layers".

Layer 1 is founders. Suppose you all start working about the same time.

Layer 2 is early employees. They didn't start the company, they joined as a job and they get a salary.

Layer 3 is later employees. By the time they join the company, it's going pretty well.

The founders should end up with about 50% of the company, total. 

Each of the next five layers of employees should end up with about 10% of the company, split equally among everyone in the layer.

You don't have to follow this exact formula but the basic idea is that you set up "stripes" of seniority, where the top stripe took the most risk and the bottom stripe took the least, and each "stripe" shares an equal number of shares, which magically gives employees more shares for joining early.

A different way to use the stripes is for seniority. Your top stripe is the founders, below that you reserve a whole stripe for the fancy CEO that you recruited who insisted on owning 10%, the stripe below that is for the early employees and also the top managers, etc. 

However you organize the stripes, it should be simple and clear and easy to understand, and not prone to arguments.

You must have vesting. Preferably 4 or 5 years. Nobody earns their shares until they've stayed with the company for a year. A good vesting schedule is 25% in the first year, 2% each additional month.

What happens if you raise an investment? The investment can come from anywhere... an angel, a VC, or someone's dad. Basically, the answer is simple: the investment just dilutes everyone.

Using the example from above... we're two founders, we gave ourselves 2500 shares each, so we each own 50%, and now we go to a VC and he offers to give us a million dollars in exchange for 1/3rd of the company.

1/3rd of the company is 2500 shares. So you make another 2500 shares and give them to the VC. He owns 1/3rd and you each own 1/3rd. That's all there is to it.

What happens if someone doesn't need to take a salary? Don't handle this with shares. Instead, keep a ledger of how much the person earns, and later pay them back in cash. 

Should I get more equity because it was my idea? No. Working on the company is what causes value, not the idea.

What if one of the founders doesn't work full time on the company? Then they're not a founder. 

What if someone contributes equipment or other valuable goods (patents, domain names, etc) to the company? Great. Pay for that in cash or IOUs, not shares. 

How much should the investors own vs. the founders and employees? That depends on market conditions. Realistically, if the investors end up owning more than 50%, the founders are going to feel like sharecroppers and lose motivation, so good investors don't get greedy that way.

There is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem, but anything you can do to make it simple, transparent, straightforward, and, above-all, fair, will make your company much more likely to be successful.
