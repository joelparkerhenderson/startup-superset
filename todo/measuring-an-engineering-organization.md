## Measure for yourself

**Measure to plan.** What would help you align with cross-functional stakeholders to decide what to ship in a given quarter, half or year?

**Measure to operate.** What do you need to know to be confident that your software and teams are operating effectively on a day-to-day basis?

**Measure to optimize.** What do you need to know to effectively invest time into improving engineering productivity?

**Measure to inspire and aspire.** How can you concisely communicate you transformational impact to the business?


## Measure for stakeholders

**Measure for your CEO**. Many experienced managers manage through inspection, which means you measure something, set a concrete goal against it, and share progress updates. If they dig into your measurements, they’ll focus on engineering’s contribution to the business strategy itself, rather than the micro-optimizations of how engineering works day-to-day.

**Measure for finance.** 1. How is actual headcount trending compared to budgeted headcount? 2. How are actual vendor costs trending compared to budgeted vendor costs? 3. Which engineering costs can be capitalized instead of expensed, and how do we justify that in the case of an audit? 4. How is alignment with investment thesis for allocating capacity across business priorities and business units?

**Measure for strategic peer organizations.** Your best peer organizations are proactive partners in maximizing engineering’s business impact. Optimistically, this is because these functions are led by enlightened business visionaries. More practically, it’s because their impact is constrained by engineering’s impact, so by optimizing engineering’s impact, they simultaneously optimize their own.

**Measure for tactical peer organizations.** Tactical organizations are held accountable to concrete numbers, and likewise want to hold other organizations accountable to concrete numbers of their own. Find something that you and the peer organization are able to agree upon, identify a cadence for discussing how effective that measure is at representing the real cross-organizational need, and iterate over time
