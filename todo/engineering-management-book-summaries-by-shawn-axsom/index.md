It’s Your Ship - By Captain D. Michael Abrashoff. Lead with purpose, vision, and create a team of leaders. Focus on listening, in order to build up your people into leaders.

The Culture Code - By Daniel Coyle. Psychological Safety is conducive to strong group work. Vulnerability gives people a signal to speak up and cooperate.

No Rules Rules - By Reed Hastings and Erin Meyer. Netflix leads with freedom, responsibility, and low red tape. Employees are empowered to make bottom-up decisions. Recruit high performers; release mediocre performers.

Working Backwards - By Bill Carr and Colin Bryar. Narrative-driven documents work well for facilitating in-depth discussion, even for executive presentations. Use PR/FAQs to start with the end in mind, predicting successes or failures of the final product, and responding to concerns within the planning process.   Focus on inputs, not outputs. Look at and measure what levers can be pulled, not the indirect outcome.

Thinking in Systems - By Donella Meadows. Most multi-part organizations can be thought of in systems. Systems include stocks, flows, and feedback loops. Feedback loop types vary; some have goals of an equillibrium outcome, others amplify into a virtuous cycle.

Never Split the Difference - By Chris Voss. Negotiations and difficult discussions can benefit from unconventional highly practical approaches. Mirroring, labeling, and reframing can help people engage in active listening.

Atomic Habits - By ? - Create habits that build off each other and are maintainable. Aim to make 1% improvements each day.

The Manager’s Path - By Camille Fournier. Include the team in decisions and challenges. It’s unrealistic to think you can or should shield your team from everything.
