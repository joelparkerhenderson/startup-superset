# Lean startup

Lean startup is a methodology for developing businesses and products, which aims to shorten product development cycles and rapidly discover if a proposed business model is viable. This is achieved by adopting a combination of business-hypothesis-driven experimentation, iterative product releases, and validated learning.

Customer feedback during the development of products or services is integral to the lean startup process, and ensures that the company does not invest time designing features or services that consumers do not want. This is done primarily through two processes, using key performance indicators and a continuous deployment process.

The lean startup methodology asserts that the "lean has nothing to do with how much money a company raises"; rather it has everything to do with assessing the specific demands of consumers and how to meet that demand using the least amount of resources possible.


## Customer development

The book "The Four Steps to the Epiphany" recommends these four lean startup steps:

  * Customer discovery tests hypotheses about the nature of the problem, interest in the product or service solution, and business viability.

  * Customer validation tests the business viability through customer purchases and in the process creates a "sales road map", a proven and repeatable sales process. Customer discovery and customer validation corroborate the business model.

  * Customer creation executes the business plan by scaling through customer acquisition, creating user demand and directing it toward the company's sales channels.

  * Company building formalizes and standardizes company departments and operations.


## Cautions

It is important to be critical and skeptical of lean startup methods rather than pre-supposing that they will be effective. The concept of validated learning applies to the lean startup methods themselves, and not just to products.

  * Clients may not be motivated to invest time and effort into helping iterate a minimal viable product; instead they wanted a more polished product to begin with. 

  * It's possible that no early adopters are willing to try to give feedback on unpolished software simply to be the first to get a chance at it. 

  * A lean startup methodology could distract from essential traditional management practices like development discipline and budget protection.
