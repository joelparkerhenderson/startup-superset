# Allen curve

In communication theory, the Allen curve is a graphical representation that reveals the exponential drop in frequency of communication between engineers as the distance between them increases. It was discovered by Massachusetts Institute of Technology Professor Thomas J. Allen in the late 1970s.

A related and highly significant finding of Allen's was his identification of the key role of information gatekeepers. Often such interlocutors were poorly recognized by management and yet conveyed vital concepts from just the right people to just the right other people in the organization.

## Discovery

During the late 1970s, Allen undertook a project to determine how the distance between engineersâ€™ offices affects the frequency of technical communication between them. The result of that research produced what is now known as the Allen Curve, revealing a strong negative correlation between physical distance and the frequency of communication between work stations. The finding also revealed the critical distance of 50 meters for weekly technical communication.

## Recent development

With the fast advancement of internet and sharp drop of telecommunication cost, some[who?] wonder about the application of the Allen Curve in today's corporate environment. In 2007, Allen examined this question and the effects of frequency still holds true, citing a 1986 study of email[2] and his own 1989 study[3] of frequency of communication between "sites of a geographically dispersed computer manufacturer". He says[4]

"For example, rather than finding that the probability of telephone communication increases with distance, as face-to-face probability decays, our data show a decay in the use of all communication media with distance (following a "near-field" rise)." [p. 58]

"We do not keep separate sets of people, some of whom we communicate with by one medium and some by another. The more often we see someone face-to-face, the more likely it is that we will also telephone that person or communicate by another medium." [p. 58]
