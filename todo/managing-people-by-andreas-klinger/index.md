# Managing people by Andreas Klinger

I believe almost all first-time founders burn out their first employees as they learn how to manage groups of people. I wrote this article for managers of small teams at small startups.

Your job is to lead people and to manage processes.

  * Lead people by example and with empathy. People have goals, motivations, fears, strengths, weakness, and lives outside of work.

  * Manage processes based on how you want work to be done, where you want each person's authority to start and stop, how careers are made, and how things can be discussed and improved. Don't micro-manage.

Processes are expectations made explicit.

  * Create explicit processes and expect people to use them.

  * Processes can be as simple as "every morning we all do X to ensure everyone else is able to work well". Processes don't need to be complex, don't need to be long, and don't need to have horrible overheads.

As a manager, you are in charge of people and processes.

  * You hired (or did not fire) the people that are involved.

  * You created (or did not stop) the processes that are involved.

  * You know (or should know) the most about your people and processes.

Be clear who makes decisions versus who adds opinions.

  * In every discussion/project/problem/situation, one person makes the decision. That person leads the follow-up work.

  * Everyone else just adds opinions. This includes people of higher "rank" or pay.

  * The manager has a handbrake they can use to hard-stop decisions.    Pull the handbrake if absolutely necessary, then discuss how to fix the situation. Expect some damage.

Hire good decision-makers; fire poor decision-makers.

  * Good decision-making skills include listening to other people's opinions.
    
  * In case of doubt, see if you can trust the decision-maker by default.

Ownership

  * The goal is to get people to own a problem space fully. This is hard.

  * Trust people and enable them to make mistakes (within damage barriers)

  * The worst thing that can happen is that you frequently step in, and people disassociate from their work.

Avoid back and forth

  * Define your processes to minimize back and forth. 

  * If you give feedback to someone on something, then assume the person will either do it or get back to you with reasons why not.

   * Enable people to work without needing to get your approval. Ain't nobody got time for that.

Trust

    * It's easy to trust when things go well. The challenge is to trust when things go wrong.

    * Separate your frustration about a situation from your frustration about a person or your frustration about your own insecurity.

    * Stay in the loop, set expectations, voice your opinions, but let your people handle it. Use your handbrake if needed.

Trust through transparency

  * The easiest way to have people trust your work is by transparently sharing it.

  * Have everything accessible where people will look for it. Don't make them ask for it, because most won't

  * Think of trust as something that you systemize. You can trust different people with different things at different times.

Don't confuse autonomy and abandonment

  * I frequently meet founders who hire people "and get out of their way". While this is principle correct it doesn't absolve you from enabling them to succeed.

Decision Layering

  * Different people in the company on various levels rely on each other on doing their work.
    
  * A product manager can't do their job if the CEO doesn't know what their current priorities are.
    
  * Don't load your work onto others in the company. 

  * Avoid stepping into their work just because looks more fun.

Avoid drive-by management

 * Don't start throwing your opinion or ideas around in meetings. You most likely lack context, and likely won't be the person doing the follow through.

 *  Make it clear when it's your opinion, and not your decision. Know the power that the "opinion of the founder (or manager)" has towards most employees.

Feedback

  * People x Context = Output
    
  * Great people in bad setups tend to have subpar output. Ordinary people in great setups tend to have superpar output.

  * Discuss the context objectively, not the person themselves.

  * What is the situation? What is currently required? What if anything has changed? 

  * If a junior engineer not keeping up with the work, then is it their fault? Or is your team right now not able to support a junior learning the game? This is ok, but should be either fixed or acknowledged.

  * Has a huge production incident happened? How was this possible in the first place? Where was the focus of the team? Was there a process in place to avoid it? Should there be one? Was this for good reasons (e.g. release pressure) or bad reasons (e.g. lack of skill)? The person breaking production isn't at fault here.

  * Always assume people you hired are motivated, and have the best intentions in mind. Fire people who don't.

Firing should never be a surprise

  * When you discontinue someone, you do it usually because of context: the company changed, or the role expectations changed, or you looked for the wrong hiring criteria. It's most likely more your fault than their fault.

  * They might have hoped that their new efforts were enough. But they will still understand when you fire them

Never delay firing

    Once you decide to fire someone, do it. Start directly with the topic and have explicit clarity on the next steps. Make sure to communicate it as fact and truth. Remember that in this moment it's not about your feelings or problems. Then help them finding new roles.

Explicit > Implicit

    Clear decisions after meetings
        No clear decision? Make that explicit too.
    Clear owners
        No clear owner? Make that explicit too.
    Hear everyone's opinions 
        Make explicit who makes the decision
        And what the decision is
    etc

Best practices: Start by making true what's real

    When looking for best practices or changes in the team/processes, always look at first what already naturally emerged
        If you hire good people they usually start looking for solutions naturally
        Is this good? If yes make it explicit
            "Make true what is real"
        If not discuss changing it

Expect to refactor your company every few months

    Fast-growing startups have to refactor how they operate internally every 3-6 months
        So just go with the minimum changes you currently need
    There will never be a final endstate
        You will always be unhappy with processes in your company
        You will have growing pains until you stagnate 
    Use the same principles you'd use in refactoring code
        Consider to 
            Test in small isolation first
            Peer review
            Not to change everything at once
            Avoid over-engineering
            etc

Burnout

  * Burnout comes from a felt loss of control and/or impact.

  * It's a common misconception that burnouts come from hard work. 

  * How can you give people control over their impact?

  * How can you define boundaries around chaos around them?

Chaos is felt less by the people creating it.

 * A common frustration of founders is that their team can't keep up with pivots.
    
* Founders likely have more context on changes. Founders likely know about changes sooner, and have control over them. Employees don't.

Expect more from managers that report from you

  * By default, mistakes are not their team's fault but theirs

  * By default, give them the trust needed to make decisions.

  * Share your honest opinions on things with them privately

  * They are accountable for all outcomes. They are responsible for all failures, but success is the team's achievement.

  * They should give spotlights to their team instead of taking it for themselves.
