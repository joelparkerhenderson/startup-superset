# My first startup failed – Here are 10 things I wish I'd do differently

I dedicated two years of my life to a startup that ultimately failed. We were trying to build a mobile app which would simplify the life of people with diabetes. The whole journey was interesting but also a tough experience, so here are the mistakes I made and the valuable lessons I learned.

1. All founders were technical.

  * We were three founders, all technical, with no experience or motivation for marketing and sales.

  * A team needs balance. You can’t ignore the business side of things.

2. Overcomplicating the MVP.

  * We built way too many features and developed the app simultaneously for both Android and iOS.

  * It would have been much better to validate the idea on a single platform and focus on one core feature first.

3. No competition isn’t a good thing.

  * We did a research of competitors but we haven't find any. We thought a lack of competitors was a sign of opportunity, but it should be a warning sign instead. 

  * If no one else is in the space, it most of the time means there’s no demand for a product like this.

4. Skipping idea validation and feedback.

  * We didn’t validate our idea or gather feedback from potential users.

  * If we’d spent a few weeks talking to people, we could’ve identified their real pain points and built something they actually needed.

5. Ignoring monetization.

  * We didn’t think about how we’d make money at all. 

  * We should think about that from the start.

6. No dedicated marketing effort.

  * We spent hundreds of hours building the product but no one was focused on marketing.

  * You need someone on the team who would put as much effort into marketing as the developers do into building.

7. Changing habits of your users is extremely hard:

  * Our product required users to change their routines which is a huge challenge. 

  * A better approach would’ve been solving a problem they already had, not trying to create new behaviors.

8. Wasting money on tools and infrastructure.

  * We spent quite a lot of money on hosting, email services, certifications, legal entity creation and servers. 

  * If we'd done better research, we could have a lot of these tools for free or at least cheaper.

9. No energy for marketing after launch.

  * We spent so much time and energy developing the product that by the time we launched, we were exhausted and demotivated.

  * Marketing is critical at launch, but we didn’t have the energy to start when it mattered most.

10. Underestimating the importance of networking.

  * We didn’t actively seek out mentors, advisors, or partnerships that could have guided us or opened doors.

  * Building connections with the people that are already in the industry might have helped us validate our idea and find early adopters.

Key takeaways:

  * Balance your team. 

  * Keep your MVP simple. 

  * Talk to users early. 

  * Dedicate as much effort to marketing as you do to development.

  * Understand the power of networking.
