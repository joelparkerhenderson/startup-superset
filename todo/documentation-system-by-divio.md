# Documentation system by Divio

https://documentation.divio.com/


Documentation serves four different functions: tutorials, how-to guides, technical reference, and explanation. Each requires a different kind of writing. Documentation needs to be explicitly structured around these functions, and these all must be available seperately from each other.


## Tutorials
	
Tutorials are welcome-oriented. Tutorials are for people with minimal experience who are curious about "What is this?". Tutorials teach a starter project. Tutorials are lessons.

1. Enable the user to learn by doing. 

2. Ensure the user sees progress immediately and continously. 

3. Focus on simple steps.


## Guides

Guides are task-oriented. Guides are for people with some experience with specific questions like "How do I...?". Guides are answers.

1. Solve the user's specific problem. 

2. Ensure the user sees ways to adapt the answer for their context.

3. Focus on solution results.


## References
	
References are description-oriented. References are for people with experience who need exact data. References are comprehensive.

1. Present austere facts. 

2. Ensure the user sees structures that align with the codebase. 

3. Focus on description.


## Explanations

Explanations are understanding-oriented. Explanations are for people with experience who want insight. Explanations are discussions.

1. Explore a topic area in more depth. 

2. Ensure the user sees relevant contexts, commentaries, and curiousities. 

3. Focus on knowledge enrichment.
