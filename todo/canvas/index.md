# Canvas


## Business Model Canvas

The Business Model Canvas is a strategic management template for developing new business models or documenting existing ones. It is a visual chart with elements describing a firm's value proposition, infrastructure, customers, and finances. It assists firms in aligning their activities by illustrating potential trade-offs.

The template consists of nine blocks: activities, partners, resources, value proposition, customers, customer channels, customer relationships, costs and revenue. Startups use the template (and/or other templates described below) to formulate hypotheses and change their business model based on the success or failure of tested hypotheses.


## Lean Canvas

The Lean Canvas is a version of the Business Model Canvas adapted by Ash Maurya in 2010 specifically for startups. 

The Lean Canvas focuses on addressing broad customer problems and solutions and delivering them to customer segments through a unique value proposition. "Problem" and "solution" blocks replace the "key partners" and "key activities" blocks in the Business Model Canvas, while "key metrics" and "unfair advantage" blocks replace the "key resources" and "customer relationships" blocks, respectively.


## Value Proposition Canvas

The Value Proposition Canvas is a supplement to the Business Model Canvas ("customer segment" and "value proposition" blocks) to address the customer–product relationship, the perceived value of the product or service, and potential product/market fit.

The "value proposition" block is divided into three categories—products and services, gain creators, and pain relievers—that correspond to three categories in the "customer segment" block—customer jobs, gains, and pains.


## Mission Model Canvas

The Mission Model Canvas is a version of the Business Model Canvas for entities such as government agencies that have a predetermined budget instead of a goal of raising revenue.

"Mission budget/cost" and "mission achievement/impact factors" blocks replace the "cost structure" and "revenue streams" blocks in the Business Model Canvas, while "beneficiaries", "buy-in/support" and "deployment" blocks replace the "customer segments", "customer relationships" and "channels" blocks, respectively.
