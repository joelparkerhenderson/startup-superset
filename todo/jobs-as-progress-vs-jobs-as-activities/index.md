# Jobs-As-Progress vs. Jobs-As-Activities

[Know the Two Very Different Interpretations of Jobs to be Done](https://jtbd.info/know-the-two-very-different-interpretations-of-jobs-to-be-done-5a18b748bd89)

Jobs-To-Be-Done (JTBD) has two different models:

* Jobs-As-Progress model: people choose a product because they want to “be better” in their life. Therefore, focus your efforts on how people experience emotions and psychology.

* Jobs-As-Activities model: people choose a product because they want to “do tasks” with the product. Therefore, focus your efforts on how people execute actions and plans.

And two kinds of goals:

* "Be goals" are emotional/psychological states of self-perception. Example: I want to be stronger.

* "Do goals" are functional/practical actions in service of Be goals. Example: I want to do a gym class.

Be goals are the core drivers of all our actions and decisions. No matter how well a Do goal is fulfilled, it’s a failure if the higher Be goal is unsatisfied. 

Analysis of hundreds of jobs has revealed that all jobs consist of some or all of the eight fundamental process steps: define, locate, prepare, confirm, execute, monitor, modify and conclude (see the universal job map).
