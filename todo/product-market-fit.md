# Product/market fit

Product/market fit is the degree to which a product satisfies a strong market demand. 

Product/market fit has been identified as a first step to building a successful venture in which the company meets early adopters, gathers feedback and gauges interest in its product.

Metrics can empirically verify product/market fit:

  * Low bounce rate
  * High time on site
  * Many actions per visit
  * Many returning visitors
  * High customer lifetime value
  * Low churn of active users
  * Low churn of monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
  * 40%+ of customers say the product or service is "must have"
  * 40%+ of customers would be "very disappointed" to lose access

## Perspectives

Many people interpret product/market fit as creating a so called minimum viable product that addresses and solves a problem or need that exists.

Marc Andreessen: Product/market fit means being in a good market with a product that can satisfy that market.

Sean Ellis and the startup marketing pyramid: product/market fit is a precondition for effectively scaling marketing for a company in his [5]

Steve Blank and The Four Steps to the Epiphany: product/market fit is a step in between customer validation (step #2) and customer creation (step #3).

Alexander Osterwalder and the business model canvas: product/market is achieved when business model's value proposition, customer segment, relationship, and channel are all fixed, without requiring additional pivots.


## Common mistakes

Product/market fit is not problem/solution fit. When gauging a customer's desire, companies need to be sure they are measuring desire for the product or service -- not just for a solution. Misinterpreting customers' desire for a solution as desire for a company's product or service will end up being a false positive for product/market fit.

Product/market fit is not binary. For a fledgling startup, a minimum degree of product/market fit will not be adequate in order to achieve market traction and success. Rather, what is actually required is a high degree of product/market fit, or extreme product/market fit.
