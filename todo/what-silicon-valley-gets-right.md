# What Silicon Valley "Gets Right" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not

[What Silicon Valley "Gets Right" about Software Engineers that Traditional Companies Do Not](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/what-silicon-valley-gets-right-on-software-engineers/)

I've noticed that Silicon Valley companies consistently "get" a few things that their traditional counterparts fail to either understand or implement in practice - especially in Europe. These are practices that result in faster innovation at a company-level, better professional growth for engineers, and just better "utilization", for the better word for it. In turn, Silicon Valley companies can (and do!) pay higher wages, and they get more value out of the same person.


1. Autonomy

Old: Engineers get tasks assigned to them, such as tickets or final specifications, with the objective to complete each assigned task.

New: Engineers take initative to figure out the "how" of the work, including larger decisions, with the objective to solve business problems.


2. Curiousity

Old: Engineers are highly-paid. Thus any time that they are not in front of a computer, working on their task ticket, is waste.

New: Engineers are highly-paid. This is because they can create high leverage, by coding and also by problem solving. Thus we expose them to the business, and give them ample time to think, so they can discover new leverage and new opportunities.


3. Transparency

Old: Engineers get the task specification, but do not know why something is decided or planned.

New: Engineers have access to realtime business metrics, and data sources, and can write their own queries, and create custom reports, all in order to help business decisions and planning.


4. Exposure to the business and to business metrics

Old: Discourage engineers from interacting with the rest of the business and stakeholders. Sometimes its said as "we want to shield our peple from distractions". 

New: Encourage engineers to interact with the rest of the business, and also to build relationships with stakeholders.


5. Direct communications

Old: Enforce hierarchical communication. This makes managers be information hubs and be in control. This is said to "shield" engineers. 

New: Encourage direct engineer-to-engineer communication. Cut out middlemen. This is faster, clearer, and more effective.


6. Improve developer experience

Old: Ignore developer experience problems, such as slow build times, entangled dependencies, flickering tests, brittle code, undocumented steps, unreliable systems, etc.

New: Care about engineers focusing on solving problems. Quickly improve infrastructure, platforms, site relabilty engineering, workflow pipelines, and more, all in order to help developer experience.


7. Higher leverage means higher autonomy and higher pay

Old: Pay the least possible to hire engineers who can do the tasks in the tracker.

New: Compete in pay to hire engineers who create high leverage, and create value that exceeds their pay. Leverage can come from growing the business, or increasing scale, or improving efficiencies, etc.
