**A technical solution is a journey and a goal.** 
Identify and document the context and constraints first; it saves times and surprises along the way. 
The communication between parties is the maximum speed at which your project can efficiently progress. 

**Communicating technically is an art.**
Who you talk to and what needs to be talked about should be front and center.
Over-communication and repetition help a lot; automate this with scheduled emails and templates.

**Write everything down.**
Create requirements, design documents, project proposals. Purposely block time every week to gather ideas.
Use a wiki/blog/channel/email for communicating these and related topics to your team and external interfaces.

**Agile is not efficient and doesn't scale.**
Keep the team size below 15 developers, delimit the scope, and use Kanban with a strong documentation wiki.
Plan and adjust based on deep understanding of technicalities and long term implications.

**A project is usually a business within the business.**
Your project has to be sustainable and solve a business need. Get your arguments, KPI's, and other tools ready.
Validate assumptions. Focus on what brings benefits to your customers. 

**You deal with humans: never forget that.**
Tech is built on consistent application of passion and effort from real humans who believe in a common vision.
Be crystal clear about expectations and outcomes.

**Be careful with tools.**
Use a stack that the team has the time to build up expertise in.
Always know the tools' tradeoffs. Account for the failure modes.

**Branch your roadmap ahead of time.**
Plans change, people change, contexts change. 
Have a few contingency plans ready for discussion.

**Make it your mission to know your stuff.**
There are practices in project management that are purely unjustified and not universal. 
Don't fall into the project management cargo-culting or the new management fad du jour. 

**Watch out for liabilities.**
Verify if projects are based around narratives or around real business needs. 
Assume good intent but always watch out for outliers.

**There is no complete recipe.**
Take care of yourself. Don't make the issues in the project your own issues. 
When the work is done, what stays is the impressions you made on people.
