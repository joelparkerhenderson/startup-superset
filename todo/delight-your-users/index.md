# Delight your users

Delight your users with three major flavors of interactions: 
user interface treats, ongoing encouragements, and deep flow.


## User interface treats

Concepts:

* Surprisingly pleasurable trifles
* Quick rewards that give the user a dopamine lift
* Flourishes that are adjunct, or intermittent, or random

Online examples:

* Tinder swipe gesture
* Facebook like button
* Slack Giphy images

Offline examples: 

* Free ice cream cone on your birthday
* Movie post-credit scenes, especially teasers
* A restaurant waiter giving a few extra after-dinner mints


## Ongoing encouragements

Concepts:

* Prompts to participate
* Reminders of involvement
* Rewards for frequent usage

Online examples:

* A "Share" button that forwards content to people and websites
* Amazon recommendations "Based on your history, you might like X"
* Any gamification

Offline examples:

* TV ad that says "But wait, there's more!"
* Loyalty cards at coffeeshops such as "Buy 10, get 1 free"
* Cash-back rewards for credit card purchasing


## Deep flow

Concepts:

* Immersion in the core purpose
* Sustainable participation in the core processes
* A sense of belonging in the core audience

Online examples:

* Salesforce ecosystem that integrates all your tools
* Apple Music, especially discover -> purchase -> play
* Reddit subreddits, especially ongoing discussions and memes

Offline examples:

* Nike athletic wear e.g. “Just Do It”.
* American Express credit card e.g. “Don’t Live Life Without It“.
* Disney World season passes e.g. "The Happiest Place on Earth".
