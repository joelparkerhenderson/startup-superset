# Practices

"Practices" is defined as the actual application or use of an idea, belief, or method, as opposed to theories relating to it.

"Practices" is also defined as how to perform (an activity) or exercise (a skill) repeatedly or regularly in order to improve or maintain one's proficiency.

This section is about practices in both senses.

# Continual improvement process


A continual improvement process, also often called a continuous improvement process (abbreviated as CIP or CI), is an ongoing effort to improve products, services, or processes. These efforts can seek "incremental" improvement over time or "breakthrough" improvement all at once. Delivery (customer valued) processes are constantly evaluated and improved in the light of their efficiency, effectiveness and flexibility.

Some people see CIPs as a meta-process for most management systems (such as business process management, quality management, project management, and program management).

A broader definition is that of the Institute of Quality Assurance who defined "continuous improvement as a gradual never-ending change which is: '... focused on increasing the effectiveness and/or efficiency of an organisation to fulfil its policy and objectives. It is not limited to quality initiatives. Improvement in business strategy, business results, customer, employee and supplier relationships can be subject to continual improvement. Put simply, it means ‘getting better all the time’.'"

The more-strategic elements include deciding how to increase the value of the delivery process output to the customer (effectiveness) and how much flexibility is valuable in the process to meet changing needs.


## Key areas

Some successful implementations use this approach of key CIP areas:

  * Improvements are based on many small changes rather than the radical changes that might arise from Research and Development

  * As the ideas come from the workers themselves, they are less likely to be radically different, and therefore easier to implement

  * Small improvements are less likely to require major capital investment than major process changes

  * The ideas come from the talents of the existing workforce, as opposed to using research, consultants or equipment – any of which could be very expensive

  * All employees should continually be seeking ways to improve their own performance

  * It helps encourage workers to take ownership for their work, and can help reinforce team working, thereby improving worker motivation.

# Kaizen

Kaizen is the Japanese word for "improvement". In business, kaizen refers to activities that continuously improve all functions and involve all employees from the CEO to the assembly line workers. It also applies to processes, such as purchasing and logistics, that cross organizational boundaries into the supply chain. It has been applied in healthcare, psychotherapy, life-coaching, government, and banking.

Two kaizen approaches have been distinguished:

  * Flow kaizen: oriented towards the flow of materials and information, and is often identified with the reorganization of an entire production area, even a company.

  * Process kaizen: oriented towwards improvement of individual workstands.


## Kaizen is daily

Kaizen is a daily process, the purpose of which goes beyond simple productivity improvement. It is also a process that, when done correctly, humanizes the workplace, eliminates overly hard work (muri), and teaches people how to perform experiments on their work using the scientific method and how to learn to spot and eliminate waste in business processes. 

Kaizen suggests a humanized approach to increasing productivity: "The idea is to nurture the company's people as much as it is to praise and encourage participation in kaizen activities." Successful implementation requires "the participation of workers in the improvement." People at all levels of an organization participate in kaizen, from the CEO down to janitorial staff, as well as external stakeholders when applicable. 


## Plan → Do → Check → Act

The cycle of kaizen activity can be defined as: "Plan → Do → Check → Act". This is also known as the PDCA cycle, Shewhart cycle, or Deming cycle.

  * Plan: establish objectives and processes required to deliver the desired results.

  * Do: enact the steps and gather data about the results.

  * Check: evaluate the data and results gathered from the do phase.

  * Act: improve the process, including troubleshooting any issues and root causes.


## 5 Whys

Another technique is the 5 Whys, which is a form of root cause analysis in which the user asks a series of five "why" questions about a failure that has occurred, basing each subsequent question on the answer to the previous. There are normally a series of causes stemming from one root cause, and they can be visualized using fishbone diagrams or tables. \newpage

# Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK)

The Project Management Body of Knowledge is a set of standard terminology and guidelines (a body of knowledge) for project management. 

Much of PMBOK is unique to project management e.g. critical path method and work breakdown structure (WBS). PMBOK overlaps with general management regarding planning, organising, staffing, executing and controlling the operations of an organisation. PMBOK also overlaps with financial forecasting, organisational behaviour, management science, budgeting and other planning methods.

Process groups:

  * Initiating: define a new project or a new phase.

  * Planning: establish scope, refine objectives, define actions.

  * Executing: processes performed to complete the work.

  * Monitoring and Controlling: track, review, regulate, and handle changes.

  * Closing: finalize all activities to formally close the project or phase.

Knowledge areas:

  * Project Integration Management
  
  * Project Scope management

  * Project Schedule Management

  * Project Cost Management

  * Project Quality Management

  * Project Resource Management

  * Project Communications Management

  * Project Risk Management

  * Project Procurement Management

  * Project Stakeholder Management


## The PMBOK Guide

The PMBOK Guide is the official book about PMBOK. The book intended to be a subset of the project management body of knowledge that is generally recognized as a good practice. 'Generally recognized' means the knowledge and practices described are applicable to most projects most of the time and there is a consensus about their value and usefulness. 'Good practice' means there is a general agreement that the application of the knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques can enhance the chance of success over many projects. The PMBOK Guide is generally consistent with other management standards such as ISO 9000 and the Software Engineering Institute's CMMI.

# Functional requirements vs. non-functional requirements

Functional requirements define what a system is supposed to do; non-functional requirements define how a system is supposed to be. 

Form:

  * Functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall do <requirement>", an individual action or part of the system, perhaps explicitly in the sense of a mathematical function, a black box description input, output, process and control functional model or IPO Model. 

  * Non-functional requirements are usually in the form of "system shall be <requirement>", an overall property of the system as a whole or of a particular aspect, and not a specific function. The system's overall properties commonly mark the difference between whether the development project has succeeded or failed.

Plan:

  * The plan for implementing functional requirements is usually detailed in the system design. 

  * The plan for implementing non-functional requirements is usually detailed in the system architecture, because they are usually architecturally significant requirements.


## Non-functional requirements a.k.a. quality attributes

Non-functional requirements are often called "quality attributes" of a system. Other terms for non-functional requirements are "qualities", "quality goals", "quality of service requirements", "constraints", "non-behavioral requirements", or "technical requirements".Informally these are sometimes called the "ilities", from attributes with names such as accessibility, portability, etc. 

Non-functional requirements can be divided into two main categories:

  * Execution qualities, such as safety, security and usability, which are observable during operation (at run time).

  * Evolution qualities, such as testability, maintainability, extensibility and scalability, which are embodied in the static structure of the system.

Example qualities: accessibility, accountability, accuracy, adaptability, adaptivity, administrability, affordability, agility, auditability, autonomy, automatability, atomicity, availability, compatibility, composability, configurability, controllability, consistency, continuity, credibility, customizability, debugability, degradability, determinability, demonstrability, dependability, deployability, discoverability, distributability, durability, efficiency, evolvability, extensibility, fidelity, flexibility, heterogeneity, homogeneity, inspectability, installability, integrity, interchangeability, interoperability, instrumentability, isolateability, learnability, maintainability, manageability, mobility, modifiability, modularity, monitorability, observability, operability, orthogonality, portability, predictability, producibility, provability, recoverability, reliability, repeatability, reproducibility, reusability, scalability, schedulability, serviceability, securability, separability, simplicity, stability, supportability, survivability, sustainability, tailorability, testability, traceability, transparency, ubiquity, understandability, upgradability, usability, warrantability.

# Queueing theory

[Source](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/queueing_theory)

Queueing theory is the mathematical study of waiting lines, or queues. We use queueing theory in our software development, for purposes such as project management kanban boards, inter-process communication message queues, and devops continuous deployment pipelines.

We use queueing theory in our software projects for many purposes:

  * Project management kanban boards

  * Inter-process communication message queues

  * Devops continuous deployment pipelines


## Queue types

Queue types and service types describe how the queue chooses which items to process.

  * First In First Out (FIFO): serve the customer who has been waiting for the longest time.

  * Last In First Out (LIFO): serve the customer who has been waiting for the shortest time.

  * Priority: serve customers based on their priority level e.g. status, urgency, payment.

  * Shortest Job First (SJF): serve the customer who needs the smallest amount of service.

  * Longest Job First (LJF): serve the customer who needs the largest amount of service.

  * Time Sharing: serve everyone at the same time; service capacity is distributed evenly.


## Queue notation

The most important notation:

  * λ: arrival rate. This measures how fast new items are coming into the queue.

  * μ: service rate. This measures how fast items in the queue are being handled.

  * σ: dropout rate. This measures how fast items are skipping out the queue unhandled.

  * ρ: utilization ratio = λ / μ

  * ε: error ratio = service failure count / service total count

  * τ: lead time = from arrival to finish

  * ω: wait time = from arrival to start of work

  * φ: work time = from start of work to finish

  * θ: step time = from finish to next finish

# Domain driven design (DDD) - building blocks

**Entity**

  * An object that is not defined by its attributes, but rather by a thread of continuity and its identity.

  * Example: Most airlines distinguish each seat uniquely on every flight. Each seat is an entity in this context. However, Southwest Airlines, EasyJet and Ryanair do not distinguish between every seat; all seats are the same. In this context, a seat is actually a value object.

**Value object**

  * An object that contains attributes but has no conceptual identity. They should be treated as immutable.

  * Example: When people exchange business cards, they generally do not distinguish between each unique card; they are only concerned about the information printed on the card. In this context, business cards are value objects.

**Aggregate**

  * A collection of objects that are bound together by a root entity, otherwise known as an aggregate root. The aggregate root guarantees the consistency of changes being made within the aggregate by forbidding external objects from holding references to its members.

  * Example: When you drive a car, you do not have to worry about moving the wheels forward, making the engine combust with spark and fuel, etc.; you are simply driving the car. In this context, the car is an aggregate of several other objects and serves as the aggregate root to all of the other systems.

**Domain Event**

  * A domain object that defines an event (something that happens).

  * A domain event is an event that domain experts care about.

**Service**

  * When an operation does not conceptually belong to any object.

  * Following the natural contours of the problem, you can implement these operations in services. 

**Repository**

  * Methods for retrieving domain objects should delegate to a specialized Repository object such that alternative storage implementations may be easily interchanged.

**Factory**

  * Methods for creating domain objects should delegate to a specialized Factory object such that alternative implementations may be easily interchanged.

# Ricardian contract (DSL markup language)

A Ricardian contract is a method of recording a document as a contract at law, and linking it securely to other systems, such as accounting, for the contract as an issuance of value. 

Definition: "A Ricardian contract can be defined as a single document that is a) a contract offered by an issuer to holders, b) for a valuable right held by holders, and managed by the issuer, c) easily readable (like a contract on paper), d) readable by programs (parsable like a database), e) digitally signed, f) carrying the keys and server information, and g) allied with a unique and secure identifier."

A Ricarian contract is robust by using cryptographic hash functions, transparent by using readable text for legal prose, and efficient by using markup language to describe information.

A Ricardian contract places the defining elements of a legal agreement in a format that can be expressed and executed in software. The key insight is to make the format both machine readable, such that they can easily be extracted for computational purposes, and readable as an ordinary text document such that lawyers and contracting parties may read the essentials of the contract conveniently.

Legal perspective: markup language embedded within a mostly legal prose document leads to reduced transaction costs, faster dispute resolution, better enforceability, and enhanced transparency. 

Computing perspective: the contract is a software design pattern to digitize documents and have them participate within financial transactions, such as payments, without losing any of the richness of the contracting tradition.


## Relationship to programming patterns

As a programming pattern, the Ricardian Contract is like a reference - object tuple from the tradition of Object-oriented Programming. The reference is a cryptographic hash function, and the object is formed by writing classes that handle the type of contract needed; a Factory (object-oriented programming) would typically read enough of the text of the document to figure out which class type is involved, and then construct an object of that specific class over the text. Once an object is constructed, it can be interrogated for contents: the hash, name of issuer, nature of issue, keys and signature status.


## Relationship to Smart Contracts

Smart contracts, as defined in the work of Nick Szabo, are an abstract concept relating to the automated performance of an already agreed contract, whereas the Ricardian contract is a design pattern to capture the intent of the agreement of the parties, before its performance. The Ricardian Contract form easily extends to refer to code, by means of hashes as references or links to external documents.

The explicit referral to the code can pass legitimacy from over-arching legal prose to the code, thus implementing the concept of the smart contract. Refactoring to describe blockchains and to integrate references to smart contract logic created a hybrid version of the Ricardian Contract. This form proposes a tuple of {prose, parameters, code} where the parameters can particularise or specialise the legal prose and the computer code in order to create a single deal out of a template or library of components. Also known as a Ricardian triple, it can describe blockchains, smart contracts, IoT devices and persons.

# Six Sigma methodologies: DMADV and DMAIC


Six Sigma projects follow two project methodologies inspired by Deming's Plan-Do-Study-Act Cycle. These methodologies, composed of five phases each, bear the acronyms DMAIC and DMADV.


## DMADV: Define, Measure, Analyze, Design, Verify

DMADV ("duh-mad-vee", /də.ˈmæd.vi/) is used for projects aimed at creating new product or process designs.

Phases:

  * **Define** design goals that are consistent with customer demands and the enterprise strategy.

  * **Measure** and identify CTQs (characteristics that are Critical To Quality), measure product capabilities, production process capability, and measure risks.

  * **Analyze** to develop and design alternatives

  * **Design** an improved alternative, best suited per analysis in the previous step

  * **Verify** the design, set up pilot runs, implement the production process and hand it over to the process owner(s).


## DMAIC: Define, Measure, Analyze, Improve, Control

DMAIC ("duh-may-ick", /də.ˈmeɪ.ɪk/) is used for projects aimed at improving an existing business process.

Phases:

  * **Define** the system, the voice of the customer and their requirements, and the project goals, specifically.

  * **Measure** key aspects of the current process and collect relevant data; calculate the 'as-is' Process Capability.

  * **Analyze** the data to investigate and verify cause-and-effect relationships. Determine what the relationships are, and attempt to ensure that all factors have been considered. Seek out root cause of the defect under investigation.

  * **Improve** or optimize the current process based upon data analysis using techniques such as design of experiments, poka yoke or mistake proofing, and standard work to create a new, future state process. Set up pilot runs to establish process capability.

  * **Control** the future state process to ensure that any deviations from the target are corrected before they result in defects. Implement control systems such as statistical process control, production boards, visual workplaces, and continuously monitor the process. This process is repeated until the desired quality level is obtained.

# Change management

Change management (sometimes abbreviated as CM) is a collective term for all approaches to prepare and support individuals, teams, and organizations in making organizational change. 

Common change drivers include: technological evolution, process reviews, crisis, and consumer habit changes; pressure from new business entrants, acquisitions, mergers, and organizational restructuring. 

CM includes methods that redirect or redefine the use of resources, business process, budget allocations, or other modes of operation that significantly change a company or organization. 

Organizational change management (OCM) considers the full organization and what needs to change, while change management may be used solely to refer to how people and teams are affected by such organizational transition. It deals with many different disciplines, from behavioral and social sciences to information technology and business solutions.[3]

In a project-management context, the term "change management" may be used as an alternative to change control processes where in changes to the scope of a project are formally introduced and approved.


## Choosing which changes to implement

When determining which of the latest techniques or innovations to adopt, there are four major factors to be considered:

  * Levels, goals, and strategies

  * Measurement system

  * Sequence of steps

  * Implementation and organizational changes


## 8-Step Process for Leading Change

The 8-Step Process for Leading Change is a theory by Dr. John P. Kotter, a pioneer of change management and professor at the Harvard Business School.

  * Create a Sense of Urgency

  * Build a Guiding Coalition

  * Form a Strategic Vision and Initiatives

  * Enlist a Volunteer Army

  * Enable Action by Removing Barriers

  * Generate Short-Term Wins

  * Sustain Acceleration

  * Institute Change


# Successful change management

Change management involves collaboration between all employees, from entry-level to top-management. Successful change management is most likely when the

Although there are many types of organizational changes, the critical aspect is a company's ability to win the buy-in of their organization's employees on the change. 


## Managing change

Effectively managing organizational change is a four-step process:

  * Recognizing the changes in the broader business environment

  * Developing the necessary adjustments for their company's needs

  * Training their employees on the appropriate changes

  * Winning the support of the employees with the persuasiveness of the appropriate adjustments


## Success factors

Successful change management is more likely to occur if the following are included:

  * Define measurable stakeholder aims and create a business case for their achievement (which should be continuously updated)

  * Monitor assumptions, risks, dependencies, costs, return on investment, dis-benefits and cultural issues

  * Effective communication that informs various stakeholders of the reasons for the change (why?), the benefits of successful implementation (what is in it for us, and you) as well as the details of the change (when? where? who is involved? how much will it cost? etc.)

  * Devise an effective education, training and/or skills upgrading scheme for the organization

  * Counter resistance from the employees of companies and align them to overall strategic direction of the organization

  * Provide personal counseling (if required) to alleviate any change-related fears
Monitoring implementation and fine-tuning as and when required,

# Technology readiness level

Technology readiness levels (TRL) are a method of estimating technology maturity. They are determined during a Technology Readiness Assessment (TRA) that examines program concepts, technology requirements, and demonstrated technology capabilities. 

  * Level 1 - Basic principles observed and reported

  * Level 2 - Technology concept and/or application formulated

  * Level 3 - Analytical and experimental critical function and/or characteristic proof-ofconcept

  * Level 4 - Component and/or breadboard validation in laboratory environment

  * Level 5 - Component and/or breadboard validation in relevant environment

  * Level 6 - System/subsystem model or prototype demonstration in relevant environment

  * Level 7 - System prototype demonstration in real environment

  * Level 8 - Actual system completed and “flight qualified” through test and demonstration

  * Level 9 - Actual system “flight proven” through successful mission operations


## Uses

Among the advantages of TRLs:

  * Provides a common understanding of technology status

  * Risk management

  * Used to make decisions concerning technology funding

  * Used to make decisions concerning transition of technology

Some of the characteristics of TRLs that limit their utility:

  * Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or technology maturity

  * A mature product may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use in a particular system context than one of lower maturity

  * Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevance of the products' operational environment to the system at hand, as well as the product-system architectural mismatch


## Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix

For complex technologies that incorporate various development stages, a more detailed scheme called the Technology Readiness Pathway Matrix has been developed going from basic units to applications in society. This tool aims to show that a readiness level of a technology is based on a less linear process but on a more complex pathway through its application in society.

# Performance Metrics Every Early Stage Business Must Track

([Source](https://www.inc.com/craig-bloem/5-key-metrics-every-early-stage-business-must-track.html))

## Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

The easiest way to calculate CAC is to pick a specific time period and then divide your cost of marketing and sales by the number of customers you gained. For example, if you spent $1,000 to get 20 customers, your CAC is $50.

Clearly, the lower your CAC the better, but how low depends on your business model and your industry. If you're in the prepared meal kits business, your CAC may be over $100 per person. If you're selling iPhone charger cables, it'll probably need to be in the pennies.


## Retention Rate


Retention rate evaluates the percentage of customers that stay with you and the percentage that leave over a given time period. That's why it's particularly relevant for subscription business models. Also known as churn rate.

The formula can be a little complicated, but one way is to subtract the number of new customers from your total customers at the end of a given period, then divide that number by the number of customers you started the period with.

For example, if you started the month with 10 customers, gained five new ones, and lost two, the calculation is 13 (total customers at the end of the month) minus five (new customers) equals eight, divided by 10 equals .8, or 80 percent. That means your retention rate is 80 percent -- you kept 80 percent of your customers.

The goal is to keep your retention rate as high as possible, or your churn rate as low as possible. 


## Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

This metric measures the revenue you receive from repeat customers. While it can be tough to predict CLV in the early stages of a business, once you have a reasonable data set you can start to make certain assumptions.

If yours is a subscription- or recurring-revenue model and you keep your average customer for 14 months, then that 14 months' revenue can be considered your CLV.

Knowing your CLV can help you determine how much you can afford in CAC: The greater the lifetime revenue of a customer, the more you can afford to spend to acquire that customer.

CLV can also help you evaluate the quality of your customer service; some customers will leave because they don't like your products or services, but many will leave because they feel your customer service is inadequate.

# Investors' comments on metrics


## Momentum

In the earliest stages, revenue projections don’t really matter. VCs understand that this is all hypothesis, and most care more to understand how you are going to spend, not what you think you are going to earn–especially because those projections are almost never accurate. Instead, one metric that VCs intrinsically think about ‘momentum’ or rate of growth. - Arteen Arabshahi, Fika Ventures


## Reach outside your network

Personal networks comprised of former corporate colleagues and friends can be a good start; it does not necessarily mean there is a need for the product. A better indication of the market’s need for a solution is to get the attention of someone outside of your network. - Jillian Williams at Anthemis


## Actual payments

Awing readers or a jury is not the same as building a product that will actually sell. Have you talked to customers? Are they ready to put money down, even for a prototype? That’s what matters. - Ben Joffe at SOSV


## True ARR

Promises from potential customers carry very little weight relative to true ARR [annual recurring revenue] and contracts, because many times large enterprises can ‘kick the tires’ on new software for several months. Having too many outstanding LOIs or POCs can be a liability, diverting resources from product development. - Yida Gao at Struck Capital


## Outliers

Precise forecasts actually don’t matter pre-Series A. In the land of extreme uncertainty, the only immutable truth is that forecasts will inevitably be wrong. Investing is a game of outliers, and startups tend to either outperform or underperform, and there isn’t much else in between. - Hugues Lalancette at iNovia Capital


## High-performing team

The first thing I do is look at the first 10 people the founders bring on. What I want to determine is if this core team are all high-performing hitters and not too similar in backgrounds. You can hack some product/market fit and talk about that in your pitch all day, but you can’t hack a driven, high-performing team. - Razmig Hovaghimian at Graph Ventures

# Startup Metrics by Andressen Horowitz


## Business & Financial

**Bookings**: the value of a contract between the company and the customer.

**Revenue**: as recognized when the service is provided or ratably over the life of a subscription.

**Recurring Revenue (RR)**: total and per customer, annual and per month, excluding fees.

**Gross Profit**: investors want to understand how profitable the revenue stream is.

**Contract Value (CV)**: total and per customer, annual and per month, including fees.

**Life Time Value (LTV)**: the present value of future net profit from a customer over the relationship.

**Gross merchandise volume (GMV)**: total sales dollar volume of merchandise transacting in a period.

**Unearned or Deferred Revenue**: cash paid at time of the booking, in advance of revenue realization.

**Billings**: the revenue in one period plus the change in deferred revenue from the prior period.

**Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)**: the full cost of acquiring users, on a per user basis.

**Total Addressable Market (TAM)**: TAM is a way to quantify the market size/ opportunity.

**Average Revenue Per User (ARPU)**: total revenue divided by the number of users per time period.

**Gross Margins**: total sales revenue minus cost of goods sold.

**Sell-Through Rate**: number of units sold in a period divided by the number of items at the beginning.

**Inventory Turns**: talks to the capital efficiency of the business, and the quality of the inventory.

**Burn Rate**: the rate at which cash is decreasing, which predicts time left to succeed.


## Growth & Engagement

**Active Users**: Be clear on how you define “active.” Exclude inadvertent activity, such as one-time users.

**Compounded Monthly Growth Rate (CMGR)**: measures periodic growth, especially in marketplaces.

**Churn**: Be clear on how you define “churn”. Do dollars and customers, gross and net.

**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**: a gauge of customer satisfaction and loyalty to your offering.

**Network Effects**: an offering becomes more valuable as more people use it / devices join it.

**Virality**: the speed at which a product spreads from one user to another.

**Economies of Scale**: measures how production becomes as business increases in size and output.

**Sources of Traffic**: reveals platform risk e.g. dependence on a specific channel, provider, etc.

## Sales

Sales fix everything. You can screw up everything else and get through it if your product sells well.

Product comes first. Selling a product everyone wants is easy and rewarding. Selling a product no one wants is an unpleasant game of numbers.

Be relentless about working the game of numbers while the product is between the two extremes above. Even if you don’t sell anything, you’ll learn invaluable lessons.

Qualify ruthlessly. Spending time with a user who’s unlikely to buy is equivalent to doing no work at all.

Inbound is easier than outbound. If possible, build the product in a way where customers reach out to you and ask to pay.


## Marketing

Market to your users. Getting attention from people who won’t buy is a waste of your time and money.

The tiniest marketing announcements will get attention if people love your product. 

No amount of marketing will help if people don't love your product.

Try to have marketing built into the product. If possible, have the YouTube effect (your users can frequently send people a link to something interesting on your platform), and Facebook effect (if your users are on the product, their friends will need to get on the product too).

Don’t guess. Measure. 

Cut things that don’t work, double down on things that do.

Don’t say things if your competitors can’t say the opposite. For example, your competitors can’t say their product is slow, so saying yours is fast is sloppy marketing. On the other hand, your competitors can say their software is for Python programmers, so saying yours is for Ruby programmers is good marketing. Apple can get away with breaking this rule, you can’t.

Don’t use supercilious tone towards your users or competitors. It won’t help sell the product and will destroy good will.

Don’t be dismissive of criticism. Instead, use it to improve your product. Your most vocal critics will often turn into your biggest champions if you take their criticism seriously.

Product sense is everything. Learn it as quickly as you can. Being good at engineering has nothing to do with being good at product management.

Ask two questions for every product feature. Will people buy because of this feature? Will people not buy because of lack of this feature? No amount of the latter will make up for lack of the former. Don’t build features if the answer to both questions is “no”.

Don’t trust yourself — test your assumptions as much as possible.

Build a product people want to buy in spite of rough edges, not because there are no rough edges. The former is pleasant and highly paid, the latter is unpleasant and takes forever.

Make sure you know why users will have no choice but to switch to your product, and why they won’t be able to switch back. 

Beware of chicken and egg products. Make sure your product provides immediate utility.

Learn the difference between people who might buy your product and people who are just commenting. Pay obsessive attention to the former. Ignore the latter.

Minimize complexity. The simpler the product, the more likely you are to actually ship it, and the more likely you are to fix problems quickly.


## Market

Work on a problem that has an immediately useful solution, but has enormous potential for growth. If it doesn’t augment the human condition for a huge number of people in a meaningful way, it’s not worth doing. For example, Google touches billions of lives by filling a very concrete space in people’s daily routine. It changes the way people behave and perceive their immediate physical surroundings. Shoot for building a product of this magnitude.

Starting with the right idea matters. Empirically, you can only pivot so far.

Pick new ideas because they’ve been made possible by other social or technological change. Get on the train as early as possible, but make sure the technology is there to make the product be enough better that it matters.

Assume the market is efficient, and valuable ideas will be discovered by multiple teams nearly instantaneously. In an efficient market, products that win do it because they reach the top of a field over all other products designed to fill the same niche. Find your field and be the best; if there is no field, something’s wrong.

## People

Morale is very real and self-perpetuating. 

Everyone should have product sense and a shared vision for the product and the company.

Everyone should be pleasant to work with, have at least one skill relevant to the business they’re spectacular at, be extremely effective and pragmatic. 


## Personal well-being

Do everything you can not to attach your self esteem to your startup.

Do the best you can every day, then step back. Work in such a way that when the dust settles you can be proud of the choices you’ve made, regardless of the outcome.

Get away. Go hiking, visit family in another city, go dancing, play chess, tennis, anything. It will make you more effective and make the people around you happier.


## Leadership

Authority is earned. You start with a non-zero baseline. It grows if you have victories and dwindles if you don’t. Don’t try to use authority you didn’t earn.

If you work too long without victories, your investors, employees, family, and you yourself will lose faith. Work like hell not to get yourself into this position.

The standard you walk past is the standard you accept. 

Pick a small set of non-negotiable rules that matter to you most and enforce them.


## Firing

Fire people that are difficult, unproductive, unreliable, have no product sense, or aren’t pragmatic.

Fire people that cause too much friction. Some friction is good. Too much friction is deadly. 

Do it quickly.

## Funding

If you haven’t earned people’s respect yet, fundraising on traction is an order of magnitude easier than fundraising on a story. If you have to raise on a story but don’t have the reputation, something’s wrong.

Treat your fundraising pitch as a minimum viable product. Get it out, then iterate after every meeting.

Don’t fall in love with the fundraising process. Get it done and move on.

If you can’t get to ramen profitability with a team of 2 – 4 within six months to a year, something’s wrong. You can choose not to be profitable, but it must be your choice, not something forced on you.


## Investor advice 

Most investor advice is very good for optimizing and scaling a working business. Listen to it. 

Most investor advice isn’t very good for building a magical product — that’s your job.


## Founding

Split the stock between the founding team evenly.

Always have a vesting schedule.

Pick the initial team very carefully. 


## Company administration

Make most decisions by consensus. Have a CEO whose decisions are final. Make it clear from day one.

Don’t waste time picking office buildings, accountants, bookkeepers, janitors, furniture, hosted tools, payroll companies, etc. Make sure it’s good enough and move on.

Take the time to find a good, inexpensive lawyer. It will make a difference.
