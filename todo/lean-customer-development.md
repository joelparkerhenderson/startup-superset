# Lean Customer Development

"Lean Customer Development - Building Products Your Customers Will Buy" is a book: [link](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028253.do)

Customers are what make a product successful. Without customers willing to buy, it doesn’t matter how good or innovative or beautiful or reasonably priced a product is: it will fail.

Customer development is the scientific approach to understanding how you can to provide solutions in a way that works with how your customers decide, procure, buy, and use.

## Experience

In my experience across multiple companies, every hour spent on customer development has saved 5, 10, or even more hours of writing, coding, and design. That doesn’t even include the harder-to-measure costs such as opportunity cost, snowballing complexity, and eroding team morale from working hard on features that no one ends up buying and using.
