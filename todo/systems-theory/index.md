Systems theory is the interdisciplinary study of systems, i.e. cohesive groups of interrelated, interdependent parts that can be natural or human-made. Every system is bounded by space and time, influenced by its environment, defined by its structure and purpose, and expressed through its functioning. A system may be more than the sum of its parts if it expresses synergy or emergent behavior.

Changing one part of a system may affect other parts or the whole system. It may be possible to predict these changes in patterns of behavior. For systems that learn and adapt, the growth and the degree of adaptation depend upon how well the system is engaged with its environment. Some systems support other systems, maintaining the other system to prevent failure. The goals of systems theory are to model a system's dynamics, constraints, conditions, and to elucidate principles (such as purpose, measure, methods, tools) that can be discerned and applied to other systems at every level of nesting, and in a wide range of fields for achieving optimized equifinality.[1]

General systems theory is about developing broadly applicable concepts and principles, as opposed to concepts and principles specific to one domain of knowledge. It distinguishes dynamic or active systems from static or passive systems. Active systems are activity structures or components that interact in behaviours and processes. Passive systems are structures and components that are being processed. For example, a program is passive when it is a disc file and active when it runs in memory.[2] The field is related to systems thinking, machine logic, and systems engineering. 

Key concepts:

* System: a group of interacting, interdependent parts that form a complex whole.

* Boundaries: barriers that define a system and distinguish it from other systems in an environment.

* Homeostasis: the tendency of a system to be resilient with respect to external disruption and to maintain its key characteristics.

* Adaptation: the tendency of a system to make the internal changes to protect itself and keep fulfilling its purpose.

* Reciprocal transactions: circular or cyclical interactions that systems engage in such that they influence one another.

* Feedback loop: the process by which systems self-correct based on reactions from other systems in the environment.

* Throughput: the rate of energy transfer between a system and its environment over time.

* Microsystem: the system closest to the client.

* Mesosystem: relationships among systems in an environment.

* Exosystem: a relationship between two systems that has an indirect effect on a third system.
    
* Macrosystem: a larger system that influences clients, such as policies, administration of entitlement programs, and culture.

* Equifinality: the way systems can reach the same goal through different paths.

* Open and closed systems

* Chronosystem: a system composed of significant life events affecting adaptation.

* Isomorphism: structural, behavioral, and developmental features that are shared across systems.

* Systems architecture

* Systems analysis
