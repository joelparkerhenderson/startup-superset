# Gamification: game design elements

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamification

Gamification of applications typically uses game design elements as basic building blocks:

<b>Points</b> are typically numeric scores that are rewarded for achievements in a game. Points can numerically represent a player's progress, and enable behavior to be measured, and provide fast feedback, and serve as rewards.

<b>Badges</b> are typically visual representations of achievements in the game. Badges can show successes, symbolize merits, prove accomplishments, enhance social status, and symbolize membership in a group.

<b>Leaderboards</b> typically rank players and use competitive indicators of progress. Leaderboards can be motivators when players are near the next step, but demotivators when players find themselves far from a step, or at the low end of the ranking.

<p>Performance graphs</p> typically chart a player's performance over time in a game, and focus on personal improvement, intrinsic motivation, and mastery orientation. Performance graphs are individual, in contrast to leaderboards which are competitive.

<b>Meaningful stories</b> are tyipcally narrative context that give meaning, yet do not relate to the player's performance. Stories can alter the meaning of real-world activities by adding an ‘overlay’, such as being chased by zombies while going for a run.

<b>Avatars</b> are typically visual representations of players in a game. Avatars identify players, and set them apart from other players. Avatars can enable a player to adopt another identity and, in social games, to become part of a community.

<b>Teammates</b> can be other players or virtual non-player characters. Teams can induce cooperation or competition: teams can enable defined groups of players to work together towards shared objectives, or can drive players to work together against other groups.
