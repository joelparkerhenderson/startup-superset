## Landing page and dashboard

When you start a startup or project, aim to quickly create your landing page and your dashboard. The landing page is for introductions, and the dashboard is for administration.


## Landing page

A landing page is web page with the purpose of introducing a project to everyone. This can include stakeholders, users, employees, volunteers, donors, recruiters, reporters, search engines, etc.

Imagine a landing page as a kind of first-time tutorial. It's welcoming, friendly, and explains why the project is good, and helps novices understand.

A landing page can be simple, such as a static web page with one big image and a few text paragraphs. A landing page can be more sophisticated, with links (e.g. to other pages, FAQs...), updates (e.g. news, progress reports, ...), auths (e.g. sign up, login, ...), publish/subscribe (e.g. RSS, feeds, ...), introductory rich media (e.g. explainer video, presentation download, ...), onboarding (e.g. setups, overviews, ..) etc.


## Dashboard

A dashboard is view (e.g. web page, app screen, ...) with the purpose of highlighting the most-relevant most-important most-timely information for administration (e.g. of a project, website, ...), by showing instrumentation and controls that help keep things on course.

Imagine a dashboard page as akin to a automobile dashboard, where you're the driver, and you want to rapidly glance at the dashboard to know you're going the correct speed, you have enough gas or battery, and your navigation map display.

A dashboard page can be simple, such as a static web page that says "Here's what we're working on right now and how it's going". A dashboard page can be more sophisticated, with capabilities for project management (e.g. active milestones, kanban board, ..), analytics (e.g.key performance indicators, mission critical metrics, ..), important notifications (e.g. alerts, warnings, ...), administration (e.g. tooling, reporting, ...), etc.
