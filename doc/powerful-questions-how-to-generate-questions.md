# Powerful questions - how to generate questions

[Source](https://umanitoba.ca/admin/human_resources/change/media/the-art-of-powerful-questions.pdf)

"Questions can be like a lever you use to pry open the stuck lid on a paint can ... If we have a short lever, we can only just crack open the lid on the can. But if we have a longer lever, or a more dynamic question, we can open that can up much wider and really stir things up.... If the right question is applied, and it digs deep enough, then we can stir up all the creative solutions.”
