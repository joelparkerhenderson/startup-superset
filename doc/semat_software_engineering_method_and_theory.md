# SEMAT: Software Engineering Method and Theory

SEMAT (Software Engineering Method and Theory) is an initiative to reshape software engineering such that software engineering qualifies as a rigorous discipline.

  * Practice area: a common ground including the essence of software engineering

  * Education area: training for developers, academics, students, etc.

  * Theory area: a general theory of software engineering with significant benefits.

  * Community area: works with setting up legal entities, creating websites, and community growth. 


## SEMAT Essence kernel

The SEMAT Essence kernel includes “things we always have and always do” when developing software. 

  * Create common ground for discussion, improvement, comparison, and sharing.

  * Build extensible practice libraries that can evolve over time.

  * Clearly assess team progress: where they are, what to do next, and where to improve.

  * Understand the health and progress of any software endeavors regardless of the methodology.

  * Meet compliance requirements as practices and methods are now transparent and work together.


## SEMAT Alpha states

SEMAT Alpha states enable teams to measure the progress and health of their endeavors in a practice- or method-independent way. At any moment the team can identify where it is now and where it is going next. It makes the team results-focused instead of documentdriven or activity-centric. 

**Customer layer:**

Opportunity: Identified → Solution Needed → Value Established → Viable → Addressed → Benefit

Stakeholder: Recognized → Represented → Involved → In Agreement → OK to Deploy → OK in Use

**Solution layer:**

Requirements: Conceived → Bounded → Coherent → Acceptable → Addressed → Fulfilled

Software System: Architected → Demonstrable → Useable → Ready → Operational → Retired

**Endeavor layer:**

Team: Seeded → Formed → Collaborating → Performing → Adjourned

Work: Initatied → Prepared → Started → Under Control → Concluded → Closed

Way of Working: Principles → Foundation → In Use → In Place → Working Well → Retired
