# The Four Steps to the Epiphany - Introduction

Link: [The Four Steps to the Epiphany - By Steve Blank](https://web.stanford.edu/group/e145/cgi-bin/winter/drupal/upload/handouts/Four_Steps.pdf) - excerpted and edited

Every company has some methodology for product development, launch and life-cycle management. These processes provide detailed plans, checkpoints and goals for every step in getting a product out the door: sizing markets, estimating sales, developing marketing requirements documents, prioritizing product features. Yet 9 of 10 of new products are failures.

The difference between the winners and losers is simple. Products developed with senior management out in front of customers early and often - win. Products handed off to a sales and
marketing organization that has only been tangentially involved in the new product development process lose. It’s that simple. 

The fundamental truth about startups and all new products: the greatest risk is not in the development of the new product, but in the development of customers and markets. We have to ask and answer very basic questions: What are the problems? Do people perceive these problems as important? How big are these problem? 


## Objectives

What kind of objectives would a startup want or need? That’s the key question. Simply put, a startup should focus on reaching a deep understanding of customers and their problems, discovering a repeatable road map of how they buy, and building a financial model that results in profitability.

The appropriate milestones that measure a startup’s progress answer these questions and more:

  * How well do we understand our customers’ businesses and their problems?

  * How much will our customers pay and how much will be our profit?

  * Have we found visionary customers who will buy a product early? 

  * Why do we believe our models are right, and what do we do if they turn out wrong?


## Technology Life Cycle and The Chasm vs. Customer Development

The closest thing to a Holy Grail for activities in startups is the Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve and the notion of Crossing The Chasm. 

The Technology Life Cycle Adoption Curve, along with the books written about it, emphasize “execution and adoption.” That’s all fine and good, but in the early stages of a startup, focusing on “execution” will put you out of business. Instead, you need a “learning and discovery” process so you can get the company to the point where you know what to execute.

So instead of dreaming up ways to cross The Chasm, the first step for a startup is to focus on learning and discovery processes, from starting the company to scaling the business. Through trial and error, hiring and firing, startups that succeed have invented a parallel process to product development that is customer-and market-centric, that I call “Customer Development”.
