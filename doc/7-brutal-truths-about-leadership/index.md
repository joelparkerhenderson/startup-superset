**1. Leaders must face conflict to solve problems.** Leaders cut through conflict with active listening skills, to understand a situation from all angles. This is a faster solution to resolving an issue than running away from conflict.

**2. Leaders must grow people.** Leaders spend considerable time helping the lives of others through mentoring and by exposing them to new responsibilities that will stretch their development. Leaders form lasting relationships that lead to results.

**3. Leaders must put employees ahead of customers.** Leaders realize that their No. 1 customer is their employees. If they take care of their people, train them, and empower them, those people will become fully engaged about what they do. In turn, they will reach out and take care of their second most important customer--the people who buy their products or services.

**4. Leaders must make the workplace safe.** Leaders foster a culture of safety -- meaning employees are free to speak up, experiment, give feedback, and ask for help. This leads to better learning, better performance outcomes, and achieving a company’s full potential.

**5. Leaders must be willing to listen to feedback.** Leaders listen to ideas, opinions, and constructive feedback from others about their own leadership. A leader who listens well is open and accountable; they probe, and ask questions, and listen to understand--with a focus on the future, not on the past.

**6. Leaders must apply the strength of vulnerability.** Vulnerability is about trust -- the backbone of successful leadership. Employees and leaders who trust one another learn to be comfortable being open to one another around their failures, weaknesses, even fears.

**7. Leaders must act with love and care.** In a world of empty promises, manipulation, and deception, a true leader cares for the well-being of others; the leader shows commitment to advancing the best interests of those around her. The word “love,” in a leadership-at-work sense, is not a feeling -- it’s a verb; it’s packed with action. It shows up in meeting the needs of others to get results, clearing obstacles from people’s path, and empowering others to succeed as workers and human beings. It has intrinsic value for both leader and employee.
