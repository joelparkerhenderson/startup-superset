# Startup analytics best practices


## Embrace Lean Startup Analytics

You’ve heard of lean startups. Well, a major part of being a lean startup is embracing lean analytics. Trim the fat! Select a few high impact metrics and focus on them. Move them forward at all costs. Tunnel vision. No unnecessary distractions. Your data is just a reflection of the strategy you have for your product. Data is yet another form of information that helps you validate that your strategy is working. So you want to focus on a few key metrics and make sure you’re doing a good job there – and mostly ignore everything else.


## Go from Big Picture to Small Picture

What analytics should you choose? How do you go about eliminating the metrics that don’t matter? The easiest way to narrow in on the metrics you should be measuring is to work from big picture to small picture. Let’s say you’re in the early stages and your primary goal is to get free user signups. Everything you do and everything you measure has to tie directly back to getting more free user signups – or it’s out.


## Startup Metrics for Pirates

Dave McClure created an amazing deck called Startup Metrics for Pirates, and it broke down analytics into five categories. The acquisition category is anything related to how visitors come to you. The activation category is anything related to how visitors experience you for the first time. The retention category is anything related to visitors coming back again. The referral category is anything related to visitors telling others about you. The revenue category is anything related to monetization.


## Only Deal in Significant Numbers

Significant numbers, by definition, are related to precision. Even after we’ve been convinced of the importance of collecting data and acting on data, we have to determine what data to act on. We definitely can’t act on all of our data. The percent change in bounce rate over the past hour isn’t actionable. It’s not a significant number. A significant number clearly indicates a trend and the need for action.


## Test Everything. Seriously.

You’ve heard it a million times and it’s true. It’s all about the better, faster, stronger mindset.

Start with a few multivariate tests and choose a winner. Then, scale down and start running A/B tests. A/B test the obvious items first. Once you have winners, test the most insignificant things you can think of. You’ll surprise yourself.

When you think you’ve tested everything you possibly can, test some more. It sounds ridiculous and it’s a lot of work, but these are the most actionable metrics you’ll find.
