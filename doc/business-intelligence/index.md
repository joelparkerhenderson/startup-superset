# Business intelligence

Business intelligence (BI) comprises the strategies and technologies used by enterprises for the data analysis of business information.

BI technologies provide historical, current and predictive views of business operations. 

Common functions of business intelligence technologies include reporting, online analytical processing, analytics, data mining, process mining, complex event processing, business performance management, benchmarking, text mining, predictive analytics and prescriptive analytics. 

BI technologies can handle large amounts of structured and sometimes unstructured data to help identify, develop and otherwise create new strategic business opportunities. They aim to allow for the easy interpretation of these big data. Identifying new opportunities and implementing an effective strategy based on insights can provide businesses with a competitive market advantage and long-term stability.


## BI elements

Some elements of business intelligence are:

  * Multidimensional aggregation and allocation

  * Denormalization, tagging, and standardization

  * Realtime reporting with analytical alert

  * A method of interfacing with unstructured data sources

  * Group consolidation, budgeting and rolling forecasts

  * Statistical inference and probabilistic simulation

  * Key performance indicators optimization

  * Version control and process management

  * Open item management


## BI landscapes

At a macro level, all BI landscapes have the same format of five pillars and five foundations.

  * Five pillars: data sources, data integration, data management, reporting, information dissemination.

  * Five foundations: data security, data quality, metadata management, data governance, people & culture.

 Business intelligence can be divided into querying, reporting, online analytical processing (OLAP), alerting, and business analytics. Business analytics is the subset of BI focusing on statistics, prediction, and optimization, rather than reporting.
