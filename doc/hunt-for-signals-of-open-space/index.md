## Size up the competition

Are the competitors good? Is it a great team that can crank out fast follows? How strong is their brand? 

Many good ideas have bad implementations, so if you can come in strong and do it well you can win.


## Look for structural disadvantages

Are there unfair distribution mechanisms or other barriers? 

Some crowded markets are indeed crowded or not worth it. Selling niche software tools to big pharma is an example, because there is just a small number of customers. IoT is an example, because large enterprises have a significant advantage because they can integrate and distribute, as opposed to a startup that makes a single ‘smart’ device, which doesn’t scale.


## Suss out if there’s room

Is it a winner-take-all or winner-take-most market? Or is it more of an oligopoly structure? 

You need to measure how much room there is. People often think it’s ‘game over,’ which if you look at things like payments, isn’t always the case.


## Calculate potential customers

Are customers actually being served well? What's the total penetration versus what it should be? How many people are actually utilizing the product and what is the true potential? 

These questions can uncover that the incumbent product isn’t great. 

Part of the reason Dropbox spread is because there was a real need there. If you think about it, the total population that should be using cloud storage solutions is close to all of the people who are online and using files. If you did the math before Dropbox came on the scene and looked at how many people were actually using a certain provider versus how many people should have been using cloud storage, you would have seen that the numbers were way off. It can be a quick back of the napkin calculation.
