# Agoge and The Gates of Fire

The agōgē (pronounced ah-yho-YEE) was the rigorous education and training program mandated for male Spartan citizens. The training involved military capabilities, athletics, hunting, dancing, singing, and social (communicating) preparation. The word "agoge" meant rearing in ancient Greek, but in this context "agoge" generally meant leading, guidance, or training.

The aim of the system was to produce strong and capable warriors. It encouraged the importance of the Spartan state over one's personal interest and generated the future elites of Sparta. The trainees would become the "walls of Sparta", because Sparta was the only Greek city with no defensive walls after they had been demolished at the order of Lycurgus. 

The agoge was prestigious throughout the Greek world, and many aristocratic families from other cities vied to send their sons to Sparta to participate in the agoge for varying periods of time. The Spartans were very selective in which young men they would permit to enroll. Such honors were usually awarded to the próxenoi of Sparta in other cities and to a few other families of supreme ancestry and importance.


## Battle of Thermopylae

The Battle of Thermopylae was fought in 480 BC between Greeks led by King Leonidas of Sparta and the Persians led by King Xerxes the Great.

The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous last stands. After the second day, a local resident betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path that led behind the Greek lines. 

Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as force multipliers. The Battle of Thermopylae and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.


## Quotations from the book "Gates of Fire"

“You are the commanders, your men will look to you and act as you do. Where there is work to do, turn your hand to it first; the men will follow. Some of you, I see, have erected tents. Strike them at once. We will all sleep as I do, in the open.” 

”Keep your men busy. When soldiers have time to talk, their talk turns to fear. Action, on the other hand, produces the appetite for more action.”

“Habit will be your champion. When you train the mind to think one way and one way only, when you refuse to allow it to think in another, that will produce great strength in battle.” 

“A warrior carries helmet and breastplate for his own protection, but his shield for the safety of the whole line.” 

“The hardship of the exercises is intended less to strengthen the back than to toughen the mind. The Spartans say that any army may win while it still has its legs under it; the real test comes when all strength is fled and the men must produce victory on will alone.”
