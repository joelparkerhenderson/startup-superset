# Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback - feedback items

Feedback is most effective when it explicitly communicates about a specific aspect of performance relative to specific target criteria, and when it provides information that helps people progress toward meeting those criteria. Feedback which informs subsequent learning is often called formative feedback. In contrast, summative feedback is that which gives a final judgment or evaluation of proficiency, such as grades or scores. 

Effective feedback involves giving students a clear picture of how their current knowledge or performance differs from the goal and providing information on adjustments that can help learners adjust to reach the goal.  Although grades and scores provide some information on the degree to which students’ performance has met the criteria, they do not explain which aspects did or did not meet the criteria and how. 

Feedback that is specific to the processes learners are engaging in has been associated with deeper learning. Too much feedback tends to overwhelm learners, and fails to communicate which aspects of their performance deviates most from the goal, and where they should focus their future efforts.  

Targeted feedback gives learners prioritized information about how their performance does or does not meet the criteria so they can understand how to improve their future performance. The full benefits of feedback can only be realized when the feedback adequately directs learners subsequent practices and when learners have the capacity to incorporate that feedback into further practice.

Consider the appropriate timing of feedback. This involves both how soon feedback is given (typically, earlier is better) as well as how often (typically, more frequently is better).   Generally, more frequent feedback leads to more efficient learning because it helps learners stay on track and address their errors before they become entrenched. 

The feedback must (1) focus learners on the key knowledge and skills you want then to learn, (2) be provided at a time and frequency when learners will be most likely to use it, and (3) be linked to additional opportunities for learners.  Each of these aspects of feedback must align with the goals you have set for learning.  

Feedback should not undermine learners’ progress in becoming independent, self-regulated learners. Giving too little detail in feedback can leave learners unclear on what they need to do to improve, whereas giving too much detail can overwhelm them or mislead them as to what aspects are higher priority. Similarly, giving feedback too infrequently can leave learners floundering. 

Strategies Addressing the Need for Targeted Feedback:

* Look for patterns of errors 

* Balance strength and weakness in your feedback

* Design frequent opportunities to give feedback

* Provide feedback at the group level

* Provide real-time feedback at the group level

* Incorporate peer feedback

* Require learner to specify how they used feedback in subsequent work
