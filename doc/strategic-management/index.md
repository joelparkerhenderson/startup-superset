# Strategic management

Strategic management involves the formulation and implementation of the major goals and initiatives taken by a company's top management on behalf of owners, based on consideration of resources and an assessment of the internal and external environments in which the organization competes.

Strategy is defined as "the determination of the basic long-term goals of an enterprise, and the adoption of courses of action and the allocation of resources necessary for carrying out these goals." Strategies are established to set direction, focus effort, define or clarify the organization, and provide consistency or guidance in response to the environment. Strategic management models often include a feedback loop to monitor execution and to inform the next round of planning.

Michael Porter identifies three principles underlying strategy:

  * Create a "unique and valuable [market] position".

  * Make trade-offs by choosing "what not to do".

  * Create "fit" by aligning company activities with one another to support the chosen strategy.

Formulation of strategy involves analyzing the environment in which the organization operates, then making a series of strategic decisions about how the organization will compete. 

Environmental analysis includes the:

  * Remote external environment, including the political, economic, social, technological, legal and environmental landscape (PESTLE).

  * Industry environment, such as the competitive behavior of rival organizations, the bargaining power of buyers/customers and suppliers, threats from new entrants to the industry, and the ability of buyers to substitute products (Porter's 5 forces).

  * Internal environment, regarding the strengths and weaknesses of the organization's resources (i.e., its people, processes and IT systems).

Strategic decisions are based on insight from the environmental assessment and are responses to strategic questions about how the organization will compete, such as:

  * What is the organization's business?
  
  * Who is the target customer for the organization's products and services?

  * Where are the customers and how do they buy? What is considered "value" to the customer?
  
  * Which businesses, products and services should be included or excluded from offerings?

  * What is the geographic scope of the business?
  
  * What differentiates the company from its competitors in the eyes of stakeholders?
  
  * Which skills and capabilities should be developed within the firm?

  * What are the important opportunities and risks for the organization?

  * How can the firm grow, through both its base business and new business?

  * How can the firm generate more value for investors?
