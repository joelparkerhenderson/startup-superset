([Source](https://neilpatel.com/blog/startup-analytics/) - excerpted and edited)

Becoming an entrepreneur is like stepping onto the most intimidating roller-coaster in the world. There are ups, there are downs, and there are unexpected turns. Sometimes you feel a little sick afterwards and sometimes you’re just inexplicably happy.

The unpredictability and the risk are what drive many entrepreneurs to the startup life. Fortunately, they can find some comfort in startup analytics. They’re logical, they’re rational and they make sense of this yo-yo lifestyle.

So, why do so many entrepreneurs find startup analytics intimidating? There are a lot of unanswered questions, a lot of blanks and a lot of gray areas. It’s time to demystify this world of analytics! It’s not as daunting as it looks. Let’s start from the very beginning…


## Why metrics matter

First and foremost, metrics help startups set goals. And, as we all know, goals are just dreams with deadlines. Without metrics, it would be next to impossible to set goals and measure our progress towards them. They’re what allow us to be constantly improving, constantly pushing forward.

Metrics also help entrepreneurs make smart, informed decisions about their startups. They can identify trends and patterns, problem areas and successes, and potential next steps. Before making major decisions (e.g. product iterations and raising capital), startups can consult their metrics. Is now the right time? Will investors take you seriously?

Without metrics, we don’t know how far we have or have not progressed. We don’t know when our startups are in trouble until it’s too late. We don’t know how to make decisions based on anything other than “entrepreneur intuition”, which definitely doesn’t have a high success rate.


## What metrics matter

The most important metrics depend on the stage of your product. Prior to product/market fit, I would focus on engagement metrics and qualitative feedback from users. This might mean DAU or churn, depending on your product category. 

The better your engagement, the better you set yourself up for growth later on. 

After your product is working and growing slowly, then my focus would be primarily on growth metrics like signup percents, invite rates, etc.
