# Steve Blank startup advice

Innovation comes from those who see things that other don’t.

Confusing testosterone with strategy is a bad idea.

Founders fit the definition of a composer: they see something no one else does. And to help them create it from nothing, they surround themselves with world-class performers.

There are no facts inside the building, so get the hell outside.

Don't believe your own b.s. It's real easy to confuse funding with success.

"Build it and they will come” is not a strategy; it’s a prayer.

Customer Development says “Glad you have these hypotheses about your startup. All of them are probably wrong.”

Progress and stability are mutually exclusive.

Number one is "Do you have curiosity?" Number two is "Does it translate to imagination?" But number three is "Did it translate to action?" That’s the difference between someone with an idea and someone who is an entrepreneur.

A startup is not a smaller version of a large company. A startup is a temporary organization in search of a scalable, repeatable, profitable business model.

Relentless execution without knowing what to execute is a crime.

In a startup, founders define the product vision and then use customer discovery to find customers and a market for that vision.

Building your product is easy. The hard part is getting customers.

The answers are easy. Asking the right questions is hard.

Only because earlyvangelists are buying into your total vision will they spend money for an incomplete, buggy, barely functions first product.

No business plan survives its first contact with customers.

Change engenders resistance, and resistance creates saboteurs.

If you're afraid to fail in a startup, you're destined to do so.

Winners understand why customers buy.

Market type influences everything a company does.
