**1. Don't say sentences that don't have numbers.** People who build giant businesses are data-driven people. They 1) know their numbers intimately, and 2) speak in precise numbers, not generalities.

**2. Pitching is a full body experience.** Pitching is a performance. Body language is a big part of communication. Use your body to move around, or you’re not communicating fully.

**3. Diagrams communicate 10x more.**  Use visuals to get your point across, speed up the conversation, and increasesthe density of the information you can communicate in a limited amount of time.

**4. Jump to the screen and point.**  When you're presenting your deck, get up and point to what you're talking about, so that the VC can focus on the point you're making.

**5. Send your Company Brief ahead of time.** Create a brief  which includes your deck and data about you that the VC needs to know to understand your business. Send it ahead.

**6. Get there early.**  Set up, get your deck on screen, check your dongles, check the whiteboard pens, and get prepared so  your presentation goes smoothly.

**7. Sit in the front of the room.** Figure out where the VCs are positioning themselves in the room, and make sure you're in front of the screen so you can get up, interact with your deck, and be dynamic.

**8. Don’t talk about your passion - show it**. Project your passion during your pitch. Show that you're going to drive the business forward through strength of will.

**9. Look the part.** Wear something nice, sharp, crisp, and shows you're serious about being a professional, running a business, and being a top competitor.

**10. Bring a pen and take notes.**  Every meeting is an opportunity for you to improve. When the VC says something that you want to remember or get back to, write it down. 

**11. Only bring your best presenters.** Base it on their personality and their skill in pitching. Don't bring people who aren't good at pitching, regardless of their role or status.

**12. Make a deck specific to every VC.** Show how what you're doing fits in with the things they know, because when you're pitching a VC, you're arming them to convince their partners.

**13. Spend 1/3 presenting, 2/3 asking questions.** Expect a “half-hour” meeting to really be 25 minutes, so pitch for 8-10 minutes, then ask questions and discuss.

**14. The goal is learning, not closing.** Ask for feedback during the meeting. VCs have seen hundreds of business plans, hundreds of patterns of success and failure, and they're available right now for free.

**15. Know when you're improving or not.** Evolve your pitch and communication as you learn how it’s understood by VCs. If interest isn’t improving, then it may be time to adjust the team/product/market.

**16. Understand VC Psychology.** VCs are being pulled apart, constantly switching contexts. VCs are entrepreneurs trying to build their work, just like you. VCs must say no all the time, but want to say yes.
