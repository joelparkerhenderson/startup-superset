# Liftoff commitment to success

A liftoff is a team meeting, and as such needs the team commitment to particpating, working together, and following up.


## Daily

An effective liftoff facilitator will send a schedule ahead of time, and ask for each team member to make the commitment to doing the liftoff.

An effective liftoff for a one-week get-together can have these kinds of general expectations for participation:

  * Available Monday-Friday, 9 a.m. to 5 p.m., on site.

  * Each day, lunch 12 p.m. to 1 p.m.

  * Each day, some pre-day preparation reading, akin to a daily briefing. This reading should take 30 minutes to an hour.

  * Typically each day, a showcase, which is typically a 1 hour video conference with a collaborator, such as a customer or advisor. The showcase concept is explained below.

  * Start on time, end on time.

  * A liftoff week can be an excellent time for team socialization beyond work topicws. If teammates choose to get together outside of the liftoff daily meetings, then make it social, welcoming, inclusive, friendly, and specifically separate from liftoff topics and work topics.


## Changes

An effective liftoff facilitator is ready for possible changes, alterations, and even interruptions.

An effective liftoff can have these kinds of general expectations for participation:

  * Sometimes a team member can commit to some of the days or hours, yet not all. In our experience, this generally works, if the team member advises the liftoff facilitator in advance.

  * Sometimes a team member needs to interrupt the process, such as to "duck out" of the liftoff to take an unexpected call or higher-priority meeting. 

  * Team members commit to advising the liftoff facilitator as soon as a probable expection of interruption is known.

  * Team members commit to using the liftoff time for the liftoff. If a team member needs to interrupt the liftoff process, then the team member exits the liftoff, and the liftoff facilitator may choose to pause the liftoff, or reschedule the liftoff agenda.
