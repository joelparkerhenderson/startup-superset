# StratML: Strategy Markup Language

Strategy Markup Language (StratML) is an XML-based standard vocabulary and schema for the information commonly contained in strategic and performance plans and reports. 

Parts:

  * StratML Part 1 specifies the elements of strategic plans, including: mission, vision, values, goals, objectives, and stakeholders. 

  * StratML Part 2 extends Part 1 to include the additional elements required for performance plans and reports, including stakeholder roles and performance indicators.

The vision of the StratML standard is: "A worldwide web of intentions, stakeholders, and results." Its more explicit purposes include enabling strategic alignment through literal linkages between performance objectives and the business records supporting them. 

Although the initial focus has been on the plans and reports that U.S. federal agencies are required to compile and maintain under the Government Performance and Results Act (GPRA), the standard has been specified generically so as to be applicable not only to all organizations, worldwide, but also to individuals who choose to lead mission/goal-directed lives.

The United States GPRA Modernization Act (GPRAMA) requires U.S. federal agencies to publish their strategic and performance plans and reports in machine-readable format. StratML is such a format.
