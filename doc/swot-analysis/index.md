# SWOT analysis: strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats

SWOT analysis (or SWOT matrix) is a strategic planning technique used to help a person or organization identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning. SWot is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. 

SWOT is an acronym for the four parameters the technique examines:

  * Strengths: characteristics of the business or project that give it an advantage over others.

  * Weaknesses: characteristics of the business that place the business or project at a disadvantage relative to others.

  * Opportunities: elements in the environment that the business or project could exploit to its advantage.

  * Threats: elements in the environment that could cause trouble for the business or project.

Users of a SWOT analysis often ask and answer questions to generate meaningful information for each category to make the tool useful and identify their competitive advantage. SWOT has been described as the tried-and-true tool of strategic analysis.

Strengths and weakness are frequently internally-related, while opportunities and threats commonly focus on the external environment. The degree to which the internal environment of the firm matches with the external environment is expressed by the concept of strategic fit. 

Identification of SWOTs is important because they can inform later steps in planning to achieve the objective:

  * First, decision-makers consider whether the objective is attainable, given the SWOTs. 

  * Second, if the objective is not attainable, decision-makers consider a different objective.

SWOT relations can suggest strategy:

  * Strong relations between strengths and opportunities can suggest an aggressive strategy. 

  * Strong relations between weaknesses and threats can suggest a defensive strategy.

SWOT can suggest tactics:

  * Matching is a tactic to find competitive advantage by matching the strengths to opportunities. 

  * Converting is a tactic to shift weaknesses or threats into strengths or opportunities.

It is prudent not to eliminate any candidate SWOT entry too quickly. The importance of individual SWOTs will be revealed by the value of the strategies they generate. 

The SVOR alternative (Strengths, Vulnerabilities, Opportunities, Risks) compares the project elements along two axes: internal and external, and positive and negative. It takes into account the mathematical link that exists between these various elements, considering also the role of infrastructures. A SVOR table provides an intricate understanding of the elements at play in a given project.
