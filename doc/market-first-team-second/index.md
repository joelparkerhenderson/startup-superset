# Market first, team second

As a general rule, when I make investments, it’s market first and the strength of the team second, which is quite different from a lot of other angel investors who are more founder-driven

Even if you have a strong founding team that’s able to pivot, they’ll probably stay trapped in the market they’re already in.

Many great teams get taken out by a terrible market. But if you’re in a great market, then the initial idea itself doesn’t matter as much — the area you’re operating in will have other great opportunities to go after.

That's why it’s critical for founders to figure out which market they are actually in.


## Anchor to real world problems

Stripe started because the founders themselves were working on other projects and realized that there were all these friction points in online payments, like the long wait to get accounts approved.

Same with Gusto, where the founders had relatives who were entrepreneurs and found that existing payroll providers were just too hard to use.

Or take Mailgun. The team kept rebuilding the same mail server and deliverability product for client after client, over and over again until they eventually launched it as a standalone because they saw the need firsthand.

The key here is that it's a real problem that you've identified, and that could be because you've gone through the pain or because you have a hypothesis and you test it.


## What would you pay?

A lot of founders will go to customers and say ‘Hey, would you want to use this?’ And customers will say ‘That's great, we'd love to use it.’ And so the founders go off and build it, but when then they come back with a product, no one’s using it. That’s because what they should have asked is, ‘What would you pay for this?’

Being interested is different than cutting a check, so part of going after something unconventional is relentlessly checking to make sure the appetite is there.
