# Ishikawa diagram a.k.a. fishbone diagram

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ishikawa_diagram

Ishikawa diagrams (also called fishbone diagrams, herringbone diagrams, cause-and-effect diagrams, or Fishikawa) are causal diagrams created by Kaoru Ishikawa that show the causes of a specific event.[1]

Common uses of the Ishikawa diagram are product design and quality defect prevention to identify potential factors causing an overall effect. Each cause or reason for imperfection is a source of variation. Causes are usually grouped into major categories to identify and classify these sources of variation.

A fishbone diagram aims to break down and organise the causes of an issue, to reveal what elements have the greatest impact. This structure helps you find smaller chunks which may have a large impact on the problem; this may make finding your solution less daunting and your problem solving more manageable.


## Pros & cons

Pros:

* Highly visual brainstorming tool which can spark further examples of root causes.

* Quickly identify if the root cause is found multiple times in the same or different causal tree.

* See all causes simultaneously.

* Good visualization for presenting issues to stakeholders.

Cons:

* Complex defects might yield a lot of causes which might become visually cluttering.

* Interrelationships between causes are not easily identifiable.


## Categories

Typical categories to explore in the diagram include:

The 8 Ms for manufacturing: man power & mind power, machine (equipment, technology), material (includes raw material, consumables, and information), method (process), measurement / medium (inspection, environment), mission (purpose, objective), management power & money power (leadership), maintenance.

The 8 Ps in product marketing: product (or service), price, place, promotion, people (personnel), process, physical evidence, performance.

The 4 Ss in service industries: surroundings, suppliers, systems, skill.
