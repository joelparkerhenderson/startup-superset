# Showcase of work in progress

A showcase is when a team shows work in progress to trusted collaborators, and asks for help to improve the work.
A good showcase start is to ask collaborates to help in three ways:

  * Look at work in progress together

  * Give direct feedback

  * Discuss the collaborator's own perspectives


## Who to invite?

Ideally showcases reach a variety of collaborators with a variety of perspectives:

  * Users: such as a customer

  * Backers: such as an investor

  * Partners: such as a supplier

  * Subject matter experts: such as an advisor

In practice, we find that there can be especially good showcase conversation if the video conference is with two participants, not just one, because the two participants tend to bounce ideas around together.


## Logistics

Ahead of time:

  * Invite a collaborator to a 50-minute video conference.

  * Share any files with them, such as this document, as you like.

  * Test the videoconferencing softwre with them to ensure it works.

A format that works well for us in practice:

  * 5 minutes: level-setting by the executive sponsor

  * 20 minute: show the existing work; the aim is brainstorming and sharing, not fixing or nixing.

  * 20 minutes: hear directly from the collaborator about their own perspectives, such as of their company, the products they use, their goals, how they spend their time, etc.; the aim is having all the teammates hear direct unfiltered outsider thoughts. Ask open-ended questions.

  * 5 minutes: conclusion by the executive sponsor, such as thanks, next steps.

Next steps:

  * Share artifacts, such as files, notes, or plans, such as by using a shared folder.

  * Follow up within a week, because showcase collaborators tend to enjoy hearing from the team.
