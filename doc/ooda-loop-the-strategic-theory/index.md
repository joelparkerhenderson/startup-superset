# OODA loop: the strategic theory

Link: "Science, Strategy and War: The Strategic Theory of John Boyd (Strategy and History)"

In any conflict all combatants go through repeated cycles of observation, orientation, decision, action. The potentially victorious combatant is the one with the cycles which are consistently quicker than his opponent, including the time required to transition from one cycle to the next.

In order to generate the tempo of operations that we desire, and to best cope with the uncertainty, disorder, and fluidity of combat, command and control must be decentralized.

The aim of a strategist is not so much to seek battle as to seek a strategic situation so advantageous that if it does not of itself product the decision, its continuation by a battle is sure to achive this.


## Three spheres: physical, mental, moral

Boyd used a concept of three spheres of war: the physical, the mental, and the moral dimension, using this idea of to structure his argument and develop three modes of conflict. 

Respectively, these spheres dealt with destruction of the enemy's physical strength (fighting power), disorganization of his mental processes (thinking power), and disintigraion of his moral will to resist (staying power). The forces operating within these spheres did so in synergistic ways, not isolated ways.

Boyd emphasized speed, tempo, variety, surprise, trust, initiative, movement, and his view that the moral and mental dimensions came before technology, superiority in numbers, and massed firepower.


## Process to evolve

An important feature of Boyd's book of air maneuvers was that Boyd did not advocate one maneuver over another, but presented the options available to the pilot and his opponent in relation to each other. He wanted to show people a variety of moves and countermoves, and the logic of its dynamic.

His aim was not to convince people about the validity of this or that doctrine, but instead to create among his audience a way of thinking, a thought process.

The process not only creates the output but also represents the key to evolve the tactics, strategies, goals, unifying themes, etc. that permit us to actively shape and adapt to the unfolding world.
