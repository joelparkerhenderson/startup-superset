# Powerful questions -

The game plan: assess, discover, create, evolve.


## Assess your current situation

Get a feel for the larger context in which you are operating. Scan the internal and external environments that may affect the future of the system orp roject you are working with. This situation analysis might include the assessment of critical results data, meetings with key stakeholders, and the mapping of your strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. It might also involve looking for “signals” — internal and external events, developments, and trends that can affect the future of your situation.


## Discover the “big questions”

Once you think you’ve posed most of the relevant questions (and there may be many of them), look for patterns and themes. You are seeking the core questions — usually three to five — that, if answered, would make the most difference to the future of the project or situation you are exploring.


## Create images of possibility

Ask yourself "What would our situation look like or be like if the ‘big questions’ were answered?" Creating vivid images of possibility differs from pie-in-the-sky visioning, especially if people with a variety of perspectives have participated in the earlier stages of your analysis. This part of the conversation can also provide clues for refining or reframing your big questions, as well as inventing creative strategies. Developing scenarios — stories of the future based on different ways your bigquestions might be answered — can also be useful.

## Evolve workable strategies

Workable strategies begin to emerge in response to compelling question sand to the images of possibility that these questions evoke. In a sense, such strategies are the “big answers” — the key initiatives you invent to address your “big questions”. Once you clarify key initiatives, you can formulate and implement specific action plans.
