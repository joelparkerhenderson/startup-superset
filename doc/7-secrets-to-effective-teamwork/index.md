# 7 secrets to effective teamwork

[Source](https://monday.com/blog/effective-teamwork)

What exactly is the magical recipe for effective teamwork? We spoke with hundreds of managers and discussed all the unique reasons. We discovered seven factors that make or break a team’s success.

**1. Set clear goals**

Your team needs specific, measurable goals to help them prioritize what’s important, drive them towards a definitive result, and give them a sense of achievement when they reach it. 

**2. Create transparency**

Mak all information, numbers, plans, and challenges, readily accessible to everyone on your team. When you create transparency, you can harness the team's full intelligence, creativity, innovation, and motivation. Everyone knows what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and how each step fits into the bigger picture. 

**3. Decide what to complete each week**

Making a list of all the tasks your team will complete this week. Assign ownership to make it clear who’s doing what. Emphasize your goal, then get to work. Working towards a concrete deadline creates a sense of urgency and forces your team to make smart decisions to reach your goals. Afterwards, review what you’ve achieved and celebrate your shared success.

**4. Recognize people’s accomplishments**

Loads of scientific studies show that people’s single biggest motivator is not money, but recognition. Being congratulated with a simple, “Great job for completing [fill in the blank]!” increases employee productivity ten-fold.

**5. Focus on processes, not tasks**

Most project management tools rely heavily on hierarchy. The problem with that is that hierarchies are really hard to navigate, and there’s always a few different ways to construct them. Instead think about steps and map them out in a flat and intuitive grid. It’s a simple way to map out a process and even better, you can replicate it for future processes.

**6. Track work visually**

As humans, we take in visual information way more quickly than we do verbal information. That’s why traffic lights are colors, not words. When you display a board on a screen in your office, everyone on your team knows exactly where things stand. Visuals are effective, not open to interpretation, and clear to everyone.

**7. Communicate in one place**

Email, check-ins, chat, staff meetings, conference calls — there are endless ways to communicate. And yet crossed wires and broken games of telephone are a continual problem for teams. The result is more meetings, more email, and more wasted time. Centralize all communication in one place. The benefit of this is that all updates are always in context.
