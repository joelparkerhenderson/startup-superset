# Eight disciplines (8Ds) problem solving 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eight_disciplines_problem_solving

Eight disciplines (8Ds) problem solving is a method to approach and to resolve problems, typically employed by engineers or other professionals. The method is focused on product and process improvement. The purpose is to identify, correct, and eliminate recurring problems. It establishes a permanent corrective action based on statistical analysis of the problem, and on the origin of the problem, by determining the root causes. It follows the logic of the PDCA cycle.

**Benefits**: effective approaches to finding a root cause, developing proper actions to eliminate root causes, and implementing the permanent corrective action. 8D helps to explore the control systems that allowed the problem to escape. The "Escape Point" is studied for the purpose of improving the ability of the Control System to detect the failure or cause when and if it should occur again. The "Prevention Loop" explores the systems that permitted the condition that allowed the Failure and Cause Mechanism to exist in the first place.

**Reference**: The Ford Motor Company 8Ds manual is extensive and covers chapter by chapter how to go about addressing, quantifying, and resolving engineering issues. It begins with a cross-functional team and concludes with a successful demonstrated resolution of the problem.


## Disciplines

D0: Preparation and Emergency Response Actions: Plan for solving the problem and determine the prerequisites. Provide emergency response actions.

D1: Use a Team: Establish a team of people with product/process knowledge. Teammates provide new perspectives and different ideas when it comes to problem solving.

D2: Describe the Problem: Specify the problem by identifying in quantifiable terms the who, what, where, when, why, how, and how many (5W2H) for the problem.

D3: Develop Interim Containment Plan: Define and implement containment actions to isolate the problem from any customer.

D4: Determine and Verify Root Causes and Escape Points: Identify all applicable causes that could explain why the problem has occurred. Also identify why the problem was not noticed at the time it occurred. All causes shall be verified or proved. One can use five whys or Ishikawa diagrams to map causes against the effect or problem identified.

D5: Verify Permanent Corrections (PCs) for Problem will resolve problem for the customer: Using pre-production programs, quantitatively confirm that the selected correction will resolve the problem. (Verify that the correction will actually solve the problem).

D6: Define and Implement Corrective Actions: Define and implement the best corrective actions. Also, validate corrective actions with empirical evidence of improvement.

D7: Prevent Recurrence / System Problems: Modify the management systems, operation systems, practices, and procedures to prevent recurrence of this and similar problems.

D8: Congratulate the Main Contributors to your Team: Recognize the collective efforts of the team. The team needs to be formally thanked by the organization.

8Ds has become a standard in the automotive,[2] assembly, and other industries that require a thorough structured problem-solving process using a team approach.
