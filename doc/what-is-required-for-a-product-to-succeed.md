# What is required for a product to succeed?

At the heart of any successful product lies a thorough analysis and some luck. Let’s look at the factors that define whether a product succeeds or fails.

## Product/market fit

The product/market fit concept is fundamental for the startup world. It defines the interplay between a product and a customer. When your customers begin to sell your product for you by sharing their positive experience with others, it is the evidence of a true market fit. You need to build a product that people not only love, but need and use daily. That defines the product’s value on the market.

## Growth

Growth is one of the fundamental goals, and is highly desired by investors and product managers. Rapid growth rates mean your idea is a rising star. If a startup does not grow and does not scale, then the startup burns out.

## Money flow

This success factor is closely linked to the previous one. If your startup growth rate is too slow, there is a risk of running out of cash and finding yourself in the graveyard of deceased ideas. Even if you already have a minimum viable product or prototype but experience a rapid drain of cash, this may indicate a poor growth rate or an inappropriate development strategy. In this case, you’re doomed to fail unless substantial changes are implemented.

## Focus on the right metrics

Proper use of startup metrics is also one of the fundamental success factors. Products with a good focus on various types of analytical and statistical data have a better chance of staying afloat in the intensely competitive ocean that is the startup space.
