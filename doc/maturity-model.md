# Maturity model

A maturity model is a business tool used to assess people/culture, processes/structures, and objects/technology.

Maturity model levels are typically a series of steps of sophistication such as:

  * Level 0: None, Never, Negligible, Not Applicable.

  * Level 1: Initiate, Investigate, Implicit, Individual-oriented, Informal-usage.

  * Level 2: Develop, Describe, Duplicate, Direct-oriented, Department-usage.

  * Level 3: Standardize, Specify, Scale, Service-oriented, Segment-usage

  * Level 4: Manage, Measure, Mainstream, Mission-oriented, Mass-usage.

  * Level 5: Orchestrate, Optimize, Ongoing, Opportunity-oriented, Organization-usage

P3M3® describes process perspectives that can be assessed at all maturity model levels:

  * Control Management: how well the organization maintains control of the initiatives currently ‘in flight’.

  * Benefits Management: how well the organization defines, tracks and ensures achievement of performance improvement from the investment.

  * Financial Management: how well the organization manages and controls the investment through business cases and budgetary control.

  * Stakeholder Management: how well the initiatives engage with and communicate with the external environment to minimize the negative implications engagement can achieve.

  * Organizational Governance: how well the organization controls the initiation and alignment of its investments with the corporate strategy.

  * Risk Management: how well the organization focuses on and mitigates the impact of threats and the leveraging of opportunities.

  * Resource Management: how well the organization develops its own talent and utilizes the opportunities from the supply chain to overcome peaks and troughs.
