# Use case

In software and systems engineering, a use case is a list of actions or event steps typically defining the interactions between an actor and a system to achieve a goal. The actor can be a human, a role, or other external system. 

In systems engineering, use cases are used at a higher level than within software engineering, often representing missions or stakeholder goals. The detailed requirements may then be captured in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) or as contractual statements.

Use cases are not well suited to capturing non-interaction based requirements of a system (such as algorithm or mathematical requirements) or non-functional requirements (such as platform, performance, timing, or safety-critical aspects). These are better specified declaratively elsewhere.

## User focused

Use cases constitute a powerful, user-centric tool for software specification. Use case modeling typically starts from identifying actors interacting with the system, and their goals or objectives the system must fulfill (i.e. using an outside perspective). This user-centered approach ensure that what has the real business value and the user really want is developed, not those trivial functions speculated from a developer or system (i.e. using an inside perspective).


## Better communication

Use cases are often written in natural languages with structured templates. This narrative textual form (legible requirement stories), understandable by almost everyone, complemented by visual UML diagrams foster better and deeper communications among all stakeholders, including customers, end-users, developers, testers and managers. 


## Quality requirements by structured exploration

Use cases are  a structured and beneficial way to get clear, stable and quality requirements systematically. Use cases improve the ability to analyze processes step by step from preconditions to postconditions, looking at every action step. This helps identify any tricky, normally hidden, seemingly trivial but realistically often costly


## Facilitate testing and user documentation

With content based upon an action or event flow structure, a model of well-written use cases also serves as an excellent groundwork and valuable guidelines for the design of test cases and user manuals of the system or product, which is an effort-worthy investment up-front. There is obvious connections between the flow paths of a use case and its test cases. Deriving functional test cases from a use case through its scenarios (running instances of a use case) is straightforward
