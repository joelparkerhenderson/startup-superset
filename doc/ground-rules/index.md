# Ground rules

Ground rules are simple guidelines that improve teamwork and communication. Ground rules may be also known as working agreements, team arrangements, shared expectations, and group understandings. Ground rules define a team's common set of expectations and ways of working together.


## Examples for everybody

Be kind.

Be candid.

Be creative.

Be constructive.


## Examples for mutual interactions

Mutual respect.

Mutual purpose.

Mutual commitment.

Mutual communication.


## Examples for partners

View the issue as “we” not “me”.

Accept where you are. It’s OK if things aren’t perfect.

Look for your part in the problem. In a partnership, partners play a role in happiness or unhappiness.

Make it safe to share. Give a heads up about a big conversation, choose a neutral time and place, etc.

Focus on one topic, rather than multiple topics.

Focus on one goal, rather than just airing your needs.

Identify the issue from each partner's perspective.

Brainstorm solutions.

Ask for a time out, if you want one.

Acknowledge that growth together is a process, and allow time for changes to happen.

If the issue can’t be solved right away, then agree to check in from time to time to discuss the issue.

If talking feels difficult, then consider using writing. For example, you can write an email or letter.

If communication feels blocked, then consider using a third party. For example, consider asking for help from a coach, couselor, meditator, therapist, or trusted friend.
