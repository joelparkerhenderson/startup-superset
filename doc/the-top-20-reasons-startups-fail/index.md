## Quotes

No market need: “Startups fail when they are not solving a market problem. We were not solving a large enough problem that we could universally serve with a scalable solution. We had great technology, great data on shopping behavior, great reputation as a though leader, great expertise, great advisors, etc, but what we didn’t have was anything that solved a pain point in a scalable way.”

Ran out of cash: “What eventually killed us was that we weren't able to raise additional funding. Despite multiple approaches and incarnations in pursuit of the ever elusive product/market fit and monetization, we eventually ran out of money and runway.”

Got outcompeted: “It was easier to have a good experience with our competitor, and that good experience came far more quickly. We had great, rational reasons to pursue what we pursued, but none of that matters if the product is harder to use.”

Not the right team: “The founding team couldn’t build an MVP on its own. That was a mistake. If the founding team can’t put out product on its own … they shouldn’t be founding a startup. We could have brought on additional co-founders, who would have been compensated primarily with equity versus cash, but we didn’t.”

Product without a business model: “Although we achieved a lot, we failed to create a scalable business … We didn’t scale because we were single channel dependent and that channel shifted on us radically and suddenly.”
