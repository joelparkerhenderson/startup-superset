# 6 Guidelines for "Getting to Yes"

From "Negotiation Skills: Negotiation Strategies and Negotiation Techniques to Help You Become a Better Negotiator", from the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School.

**1. Separate the people from the problem.**

Strive to imagine the situation from their counterpart’s viewpoint. If someone is refusing to back down from a hardline position, ask her how she thinks things are going. Exploring each side’s perceptions openly, and avoiding any tendency to blame, are key negotiation skills.

**2. Focus on interests, not positions.**

If we begin a negotiation by stating our positions, then we set ourselves up for impasse. Better to learn about the interests underlying our counterpart’s positions by asking questions, such as, “Why is this important to you?” By identifying what interests are motivating the other party, and sharing your own interests, you can open up opportunities to explore tradeoffs across issues and increase your chance of success.

**3. Learn to manage emotions.**

Be sure that you and your counterpart have ample opportunities to express and discuss any strong emotions related to your negotiation. Allowing one another to speak your mind will benefit both sides. “Freed from the burden of unexpressed emotions, people will become more likely to work on the problem.” When you know that you will have your turn to express how you’re feeling, it will be easier for you to listen when your counterpart has his turn.

**4. Express appreciation.**

Stress the importance of expressing appreciation as a means of breaking through impasse. Advise negotiators to express appreciation by working to understand the other’s perspective, seeking merit in that perspective, and communicating understanding through words and actions—all critical negotiation skills.

**5. Be positive and personal.**

Communicating in a positive way is more effective than blaming and criticizing. Communicating in a personal way is more effective than trying to speak for others. Instead of speaking on behalf of your group, speak only for yourself. Talk about what you personally have observed. Express your personal concerns.

**6. Escape the cycle of action and reaction.**

Try to avoid the common negotiation trap of action and reaction. If the other side announces a firm position, you may be tempted to criticize and reject it. If they criticize your proposal, you may be tempted to dig yourself in. If they push hard, you will tend to push back. To head off this vicious cycle, use negotiation jujitsu, which involves avoiding escalation by refusing to react. Instead, channel resistance into more productive negotiation strategies, such as exploring interests, inventing options for mutual gain, and searching for independent standards.
