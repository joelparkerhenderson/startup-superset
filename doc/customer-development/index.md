# Customer development

Customer development is a formal methodology for building startups and new corporate ventures. It is one of the three parts that make up a Lean Startup: Business Model Design, Customer Development, Agile Engineering.

The process assumes that early ventures have untested hypotheses about their business model (who are the customers, what features they want, what channel to use, revenue strategy/pricing tactics, how to get/keep/grow customers, strategic activities needed to deliver the product, internal resources needed, partners needed and costs.). Customer development starts with the key idea that there are no facts inside your building so get outside to test them. The hypotheses testing emulates the scientific method – pose a business model hypothesis, design an experiment, get out of the building and test it. Take the data and derive some insight to either 1) Validate the hypothesis, 2) Invalidate the Hypothesis or 3) Modify the hypothesis.


## Get out of the building

The customer development model encourages that more time be spent in the field identifying potential consumers and learning how to better meet their needs. The Customer Development concept emphasizes empirical research. Customer development is the opposite of the “if we build it, they will come”.

The founders must “get out of the building” and answer three questions about the business:

  * Do we really understand the customer’s problem a.k.a. need?

  * Do enough people care enough about the problem a.k.a. need, in order to create a huge business?

  * Will enough people care enough to tell their friends, in order to grow the business quickly?


## The four-step process

The customer development method consists of four steps that are designed to help avoid common pitfalls and repeat successful business strategies:

  * Customer discovery first captures the founders’ vision and turns it into a series of business model hypotheses. Then it develops a plan to test customer reactions to those hypotheses and turn them into facts.

  * Customer validation tests whether the resulting business model is repeatable and scalable. If not, founders should return to customer discovery.

  * Customer creation is the start of execution. It builds end-user demand and drives it into the sales channel to scale the business.

  * Company building transitions the organization from a startup to a company focused on executing a validated model.
