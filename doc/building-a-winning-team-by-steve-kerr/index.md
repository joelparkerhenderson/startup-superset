Coach Steve Kerr is a big reason the Oakland Warrior’s basketball team has dominated the sport, so I was curious to see what he would talk about to a room full of CIOs and technologists. It was the best conversation on leadership I’ve ever heard. 


**Tip 1: Pick a KPI and focus on it**

  * Kerr feels that if the team moves the ball it will result in a better game and thus more wins.  He is so frequently yelling “move the ball” that one time Steph Curry yelled back “Hey coach, yell something else!”

  * He consistently drills this message to move the ball into the team, every game, every practice, and this creates a dynamic and collaborative style. Find your metric and work your team to that metric.

**Tip 2: Cross-train to mix it up**

  * Kerr moves players around to positions they didn’t normally play. This demonstrates the leader’s confidence in his team members to grow and continuously become more skilled. 

  * Get teams comfortable switching roles and supporting each other to stay alive. This increases empathy. It makes each member an adaptable person with many contributions to make to the team. Team members test their strengths and build their confidence.
 
**Tip 3: Encourage self-managing teams**

  * Kerr made an uncommon (and for some unpopular) coaching decision to NOT coach the team but turn it over to the players.  “It’s the players’ team, and they have to take ownership of it. And as coaches, our job is to nudge them in the right direction, guide them, but we don’t control them. The players determine their own fate.” 

  * How can you turn the reigns over to the team? Go above and beyond delegating to allow the team to manage themselves, hear new voices, and feel trusted to make positive contributions.

**Tip 4: Give Constant Feedback**

  * Ongoing dialogue makes it easier to correct course and adjust right away. Kerr’s team members know where they are against their goals at all times.

  * Take a clue from Kerr and John Doerr, and “Measure What Matters” by establishing Objectives and Key Results (OKRs). Give team members immediate and frequent feedback on what’s working, where are they making progress, and where can improve.

**Tip 5: Always Respect Your Team**

  * Kerr’s success has come from his ability to build trust, respect, and collaborate with his team. Valuing and understanding the strengths of each person is essential. Gone are the days when “because I’m the coach” or “because I’m the boss” elicits engagement. 

  * A leader must build and demonstrate respect for their team. Own your mistakes, show vulnerability, and be real -- this helps your team do the same so you can all be there for each other.
