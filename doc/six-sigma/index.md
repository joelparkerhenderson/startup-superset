# Six Sigma

Six Sigma (6Ïƒ) is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. 

Six Sigma strategies seek to improve the quality of the output of a process by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It uses a set of quality management methods, mainly empirical, statistical methods, and creates a special infrastructure of people within the organization who are experts in these methods. Each Six Sigma project carried out within an organization follows a defined sequence of steps and has specific value targets, for example: reduce process cycle time, reduce pollution, reduce costs, increase customer satisfaction, and increase profits.


## Doctrine

Six Sigma doctrine asserts:

  * Continuous efforts to achieve stable and predictable process results (e.g. by reducing process variation) are of vital importance to business success.

  * Manufacturing and business processes have characteristics that can be defined, measured, analyzed, improved, and controlled.

  * Achieving sustained quality improvement requires commitment from the entire organization, particularly from top-level management.

Features that set Six Sigma apart from previous quality-improvement initiatives include:

  * A clear focus on achieving measurable and quantifiable financial returns from any Six Sigma project.

  * An increased emphasis on strong and passionate management leadership and support.

  * A clear commitment to making decisions on the basis of verifiable data and statistical methods, rather than assumptions and guesswork.


## Criticism

Lack of originality: Six Sigma is "a basic version of quality improvement".

Inadequate for complex manufacturing: For example, under the Six Sigma standard, semiconductors which require the flawless etching of millions of tiny circuits onto a single chip are all defective.

Role of consultants: there is overselling of Six Sigma by too great a number of consulting firms with inadequate skills or experience.

Potential negative effects: narrowly designed to fix an existing process, and interferes with coming up with new products or disruptive technologies.

Lack of rigorous proof: most cases are not documented in a systemic or academic manner, so are there true improvements or just promotional stories?
