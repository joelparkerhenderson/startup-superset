# Strategy map

A strategy map is a diagram that documents the primary strategic goals being pursued by an organization or management team. It is an element of the documentation associated with the Balanced Scorecard.

One approach to strategy maps has:

  * An underlying framework of horizontal perspectives arranged in a cause and effect relationship, typically Financial, Customer, Process and Learning & Growth.

  * Objectives within those perspectives. Each objective as text appearing within a shape (usually an oval or rectangle). Relatively few objectives (usually fewer than 20).

  * Vertical sets of linked objectives that span the perspectives. These are called strategic themes.

  * Clear cause-and-effect relationships between these objectives, across the perspectives. The strategic themes represent hypotheses about how the strategy will bring about change to the outcomes of the organization.
      
The Balanced Scorecard is a framework that is used to help in the design and implementation of strategic performance management tools within organizations.

One of the big challenges faced in the design of Balanced Scorecard-based performance management systems is deciding what activities and outcomes to monitor. By providing a simple visual representation of the strategic objectives to be focused on, along with additional visual cues in the form of the perspectives and causal arrows, the strategy map has been found useful in enabling discussion within a management team about what objectives to choose, and subsequently to support discussion of the actual performance achieved.

The perspectives are traditionally arrayed on the strategy map in the sequence (from bottom to top) "Learning & Growth", "Internal Business Processes", "Customer", "Financial" with causal arrows tending to flow "up" the page. This is to allow a sequential linkage from the investment perspective of Learning and Growth to the outcome perspectives of Customer and Financial. 

A well-designed strategy map will allow the author to 'tell a story' from the bottom to the top along the lines of "If we invest in (training, education etc) it will allow us to improve our Internal Processes which will impact our Customers (in a positive way) and improve our Financial results. In other words, Learning and Growth drive Internal Process change which impacts Customer Satisfaction which in turn improves Profitability.
Today, the lower-most perspective has been renamed to Organizational Capacity.

The strategy map is a device that promotes three stages of conversation during the strategy development, implementation and learning process, to:

  1. Capture a strategy from a management team. To promote discussion amongst that team on the strategy, so they all leave the room telling the same story of their strategy.

  2. Communicate the strategy, focus organization efforts, and choose appropriate measures to report on an organization's progress in implementing a strategy.

  3. Provide a basis to review and potentially revise the strategy, (not simply the measures or targets) and support conversations and decision making, as the team learn from the strategy's implementation.
