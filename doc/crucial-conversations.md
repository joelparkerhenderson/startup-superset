When stakes are high, opinions vary, and emotions run strong, you have three choices:

  1. Avoid a crucial conversation and suffer the consequences

  2. Handle the conversation badly and suffer the consequences

  3. Discover how to communicate best when it matters most

Prepare for high-impact situations with a six-minute mastery technique:

  * Make it safe to talk about almost anything

  * Be persuasive, not abrasive

  * Keep listening when others blow up or clam up

  * Turn crucial conversations into the action and results you want


## Simple steps to communicate best

**Get unstuck by using CPR**:
Content: the current single instance of a problem.
Pattern: any pattern of behavior over time.
Relationship: how the problem is affecting my relationship with the other person.

**Start with heart**:
What am I behaving like I want?
What results do I really want, for myself, for others, for the relationship, for the organization?
How would I behave if I really did?

**Master my stories**:
What am I pretending not to notice about my role in the problem? Watch out for "victim" stories.
Why would a reasonable, rational, decent person do this? Watch out for "villian" stories.
What should I do right now to move toward what I really want? Watch out for "helpless" stories.

**STATE my path**:
Share my facts.
Tell my stories.
Ask for other people's paths.
Talk tentatively.
Encourage testing.

**Learn to look for when when safety is at risk**:
Look for when a conversation becomes crucial.
Look for silence and violence in myself and others.

**Make it safe to talk by restoring safety**:
When there is a clear problem, then ensure mutual respect by apologizing.
When there is misalignment, ensure mutual purpose by stating it or creating it.
When there is a misunderstanding, use the "Contrast" concept.

**Create mutual purpose via CRIB**:
Commit to seek mutual purpose.
Recognize the purpose behind the strategy.
Invent a mutual purpose, such a a more creative purpose, or higher purpose.
Brainstorm new strategies.

**Explore others' paths via AMPP**:
Ask to get things rolling.
Mirror to confirm feelings.
Paraphrase to acknowledge the store.
Prime when I'm not getting anywhere.

**Move to action via WWWF**: 
Who is working on actions?
What actions are happening?
When are actions complete?
Followup planning: how/when will we follow up?
