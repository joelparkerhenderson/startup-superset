# Technology adoption life cycle

Link: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_adoption_life_cycle)

The technology adoption lifecycle is a sociological model that describes the adoption or acceptance of a new product or innovation, according to the demographic and psychological characteristics of defined adopter groups. 

The process of adoption over time is typically illustrated as a classical normal distribution or "bell curve" with five life cycle steps, explained using examples from the original research based on farming.

Life cycle steps:

  * innovators – had larger farms, were more educated, more prosperous and more risk-oriented

  * early adopters – younger, more educated, tended to be community leaders, less prosperous

  * early majority – more conservative but open to new ideas, active in community and influence to neighbours

  * late majority – older, less educated, fairly conservative and less socially active

  * laggards – very conservative, had small farms and capital, oldest and least educated


## Stewarding technology

The book "Digital habitats: Stewarding technology for communities" talks of technology stewards: people with sufficient understanding of the technology available and the technological needs of a community to steward the community through the technology adoption process.


## Crossing the Chasm

The book "Crossing the Chasm" proposes a variation of the original lifecycle. The book suggests that for discontinuous innovations, which may result in a Foster disruption based on s-curve, there is a gap or chasm between the first two adopter groups (i.e. innovators and early adopters) and rest.


## Cascade of adoption

Researcher Rayna and Striukova (2009) propose that the choice of initial market segment has crucial importance for crossing the chasm, as adoption in this segment can lead to a cascade of adoption in the other segments. This initial market segment has, at the same time, to contain a large proportion of visionaries, to be small enough for adoption to be observed from within the segment and from other segment and be sufficiently connected with other segments. If this is the case, the adoption in the first segment will progressively cascade into the adjacent segments, thereby triggering the adoption by the mass-market.
