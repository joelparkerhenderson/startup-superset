# Agile chartering

Agile chartering is a lightweight, minimum-documentation approach to creating initial understandings, agreements, and alignment about the work and how it will be accomplished.

The nature of agile chartering fosters collaboration between stakeholders and the development team and helps align everyone involved from the start.

Chartering is a discovery and negotiating activity.

  * Transform bright ideas into valid and manageable work efforts.

  * Balance the interests of gold-owners with the capabilities of the development team.

  * Ensure that the outcomes we expect are in line with the resources available to achieve them.

  * Serve as a contract that guides and supports the work.

  * Provide a reference point for re-negotiations when conditions change.

Agile chartering heuristics:

  * Whole System Collaborative Work: Focus on the inter-relationships of the whole, the parts, and the greater whole

  * GEFN (Good Enough for Now): Do just enough; resist perfecting.

  * Start Well: Begin each endeavor in a context of possibility Learn more as the work unfolds.

  * Continuous Learning: Work together to learn from one another and set the stage for discovery.
