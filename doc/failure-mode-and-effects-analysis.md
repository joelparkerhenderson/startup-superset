# Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA)

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Failure_mode_and_effects_analysis

Failure mode and effects analysis (FMEA) is the process of reviewing as many components, assemblies, and subsystems as possible to identify potential failure modes in a system and their causes and effects. For each component, the failure modes and their resulting effects on the rest of the system are recorded in a specific FMEA worksheet. A FMEA is often the first step of a system reliability study.

FMEA is an inductive reasoning (forward logic) single point of failure analysis and is a core task in reliability engineering, safety engineering and quality engineering.

FMEA helps identify potential failure modes based on experience with similar products and processesâ€”or based on common physics of failure logic. FMEA can be used to structure mitigation for risk reduction, based on failure probabilities,  effect severities, or both. FMEA may include information on causes of failure (deductive analysis) to reduce the possibility of occurrence by eliminating identified (root) causes.


## Probability & severity

**Probability (P)**: The likelihood of a failure mode. Determine this by analysis, calculations, comparables, etc. All  potential causes for a failure mode should be identified and documented. Examples of causes: human errors in handling, manufacturing faults, fatigue, creep, abrasive wear, erroneous algorithms, excessive voltage, improper operation, etc. 

**Severity (S)**: The impact of adverse end effect. Determine this in terms of what the user experiences, and also what the provider experiences. Examples of end effects: loss of function, degraded performance, erratic behavior, timing problems, etc. Assign each end effect a severity number (S) using a scale of your choice, such as based on cost and/or damage.


## Benefits

Major benefits derived from a properly implemented FMEA effort:

* Provide a documented method for selecting a design with a high probability of successful operation and safety.

* Create a documented uniform method of assessing potential failure mechanisms, failure modes and their impact on system operation, resulting in a list of failure modes ranked according to the seriousness of their system impact and likelihood of occurrence.

* Earlier identification of single failure points (SFPS) and system interface problems, which may be critical to mission success and/or safety. They also provide a method of verifying that switching between redundant elements is not jeopardized by postulated single failures.

* Contribute to effective methods for evaluating the effect of proposed changes to the design and/or operational procedures on mission success and safety.

* Establish a basis for in-flight troubleshooting procedures and for locating performance monitoring and fault-detection devices.

* Generate criteria for early planning of tests.
