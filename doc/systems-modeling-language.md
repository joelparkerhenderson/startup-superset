# Systems Modeling Language (SysML)

The Systems Modeling Language (SysML) is a general-purpose modeling language for systems engineering applications. It supports the specification, analysis, design, verification and validation of a broad range of systems and systems-of-systems.


## Diagrams

SysML includes 9 types of diagram, some of which are taken from UML.

  * Block definition diagram

  * Internal block diagram

  * Package diagram

  * Use case diagram

  * Requirement diagram

  * Activity diagram

  * Sequence diagram

  * State machine diagram

  * Parametric diagram  


## SysML vs. UML

SysML offers systems engineers several noteworthy improvements over UML, which tends to be software-centric. These improvements include the following:[2]

  * SysML's semantics are more flexible and expressive. SysML reduces UML's software-centric restrictions and adds two new diagram types, requirement and parametric diagrams. The former can be used for requirements engineering; the latter can be used for performance analysis and quantitative analysis. Consequent to these enhancements, SysML is able to model a wide range of systems, which may include hardware, software, information, processes, personnel, and facilities.

  * SysML is a comparatively little language that is easier to learn and apply.[3] Since SysML removes many of UML's software-centric constructs, the overall language measures smaller both in diagram types and total constructs.

  * SysML allocation tables support common kinds of allocations. Whereas UML provides only limited support for tabular notations, SysML furnishes flexible allocation tables that support requirements allocation, functional allocation, and structural allocation. This capability facilitates automated verification and validation (V&V) and gap analysis.

  * SysML model management constructs support models, views, and viewpoints. These constructs extend UML's capabilities and are architecturally aligned with IEEE-Std-1471-2000 (IEEE Recommended Practice for Architectural Description of Software Intensive Systems).
