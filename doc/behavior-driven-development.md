# Behavior-driven development

In software engineering, behavior-driven development (BDD) is a software development process that emerged from test-driven development (TDD). Behavior-driven development combines the general techniques and principles of TDD with ideas from domain-driven design and object-oriented analysis and design to provide software development and management teams with shared tools and a shared process to collaborate on software development.

BDD is principally an idea about how software development should be managed by both business interests and technical insight. The practice of BDD uses specialized software tools to support the development process. The tools serve to add automation to the ubiquitous language that is a central theme of BDD.

BDD is largely facilitated through the use of a simple domain-specific language (DSL) using natural language constructs (e.g., English-like sentences) that can express the behavior and the expected outcomes. Test scripts have long been a popular application of DSLs with varying degrees of sophistication. BDD is considered an effective technical practice especially when the "problem space" of the business problem to solve is complex.


## Behavior specifications

Title: 

  * The story should have a clear, explicit title.

Short introductory narrative:

  * who: is the primary actor of the story

  * what: effect the stakeholder wants the story to have

  * why: business value the stakeholder will derive from this effect

Acceptance criteria or scenarios:

  * Specify initial conditions assumed to be true at the beginning of the scenario.

  * State which event triggers the start of the scenario.

  * State the expected outcome, in one or more clauses.


## Specification as a ubiquitous language

Behavior-driven development borrows the concept of the ubiquitous language from domain driven design. A ubiquitous language is a (semi-)formal language that is shared by all members of a software development team â€” both software developers and non-technical personnel. The language in question is both used and developed by all team members as a common means of discussing the domain of the software in question. In this way BDD becomes a vehicle for communication between all the different roles in a software project.
