[Source](https://theprimes.com)

The PRIMES are universal patterns of group behavior that outfit you to work with any group to solve any problem - especially the big ones. 

The PRIMES are 46 principles of group behavior that reveal intuitive and easily applied insights into the human dynamics guiding effective collaboration and decision-making for leaders and groups.  These tools illuminate common group dilemmas that slow progress and keep you from getting the extraordinary outcomes you want.

Every leader has felt the effect of these patterns throughout their careers, but our research shows that few leaders have the time or resources to recognize, anticipate, and manage them. Unmanaged, The PRIMES will put any leadership agenda at risk. Master them and The PRIMES become a force that drives date-certain, intended outcomes.
