# Outliers: 10,000 Hours of Practice

([Source](http://wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/))

The book "Outliers" says that it takes roughly ten thousand hours of practice to achieve mastery in a field. The author studied extremely successful people to find out how they achieved success. How can we leverage this to achieve greatness in our professions?


## Natural Talent: Not Important

One fascinating point of the study: No “naturally gifted” performers emerged. If natural talent had played a role, we would expect some of the “naturals” to float to the top of the elite level with fewer practice hours than everyone else. But the data showed otherwise. The psychologists found a direct statistical relationship between hours of practice and achievement. No shortcuts. No naturals.


## Violins in Berlin

A team of psychologists in studied violin students. Specifically, they studied their practice habits in childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. All of the subjects were asked this question: “Over the course of your entire career, ever since you first picked up the violin, how many hours have you practiced?”

The elite performers averaged more than 10,000 hours of practice each, while the less able performers had only 4,000 hours of practice. The elite had more than double the practice hours of the less capable performers.


## Sneaking Out to Write Code

Microsoft was founded by Bill Gates and Paul Allen, who dropped out of college to form the company in 1975. It’s that simple: Drop out of college, start a company, and become a billionaire, right? Wrong.

Further study reveals that Gates and Allen had thousands of hours of programming practice prior to founding Microsoft. The two co-founders started programming in eighth grade, first at their elite private school, second by sneaking out to write code at the University of Washington. Gates and Allen acquired their 10,000 hours, and when the time came to launch Microsoft in 1975, the two were ready.


## Practice Makes Improvement

While they were an unknown high school rock band, the Beatles played in local clubs. The group was underpaid. The acoustics were terrible. The audiences were unappreciative. So what did the Beatles get? Non-stop hours of playing time that forced them to get better.

As the Beatles grew in skill, audiences demanded more performances – more playing time. Soon they were playing eight hours per night, seven nights per week. By the year they burst on the international scene, the Beatles had played over 1,200 concerts together. By way of comparison, most bands don’t play 1,200 times in their entire career.
