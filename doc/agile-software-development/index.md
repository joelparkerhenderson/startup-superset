# Agile software development

Agile software development is an approach to software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams and their customer(s)/end user(s). 

Agile advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, empirical knowledge, and continual improvement, and it encourages rapid and flexible response to change.

Agile business management uses agile software concepts across five domains: integrated customer engagement, facilitation-based management, agile work practices, an enabling organisational structure, and applications of agile process (along with DevOps and lean manufacturing) to data analytics and business intelligence.


## The Manifesto for Agile Software Development

The Manifesto for Agile Software Development describes the agile values and principles. These were derived from a broad range of software development frameworks, including Scrum and Kanban.

Values

  * Individuals and interactions over processes and tools

  * Working software over comprehensive documentation

  * Customer collaboration over contract negotiation

  * Responding to change over following a plan

Principles:

  * Customer satisfaction by early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

  * Welcome changing requirements, even in late development.

  * Deliver working software frequently (weeks rather than months)

  * Close, daily cooperation between business people and developers

  * Projects are built around motivated individuals, who should be trusted

  * Face-to-face conversation is the best form of communication (co-location)

  * Working software is the primary measure of progress

  * Sustainable development, able to maintain a constant pace

  * Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design

  * Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential

  * Best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams

  * Regularly, the team reflects on how to become more effective, and adjusts accordingly
