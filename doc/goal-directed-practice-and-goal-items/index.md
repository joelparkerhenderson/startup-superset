# Goal-directed practice coupled with targeted feedback - goal items

All practice is not equal. “Practice” is defined as any activity in which people engage their knowledge or skills. “Feedback” is information given to people about their performance that guides future behavior. However, the full potential of practice and feedback is not realized unless the two are combined. Practice produces observed performance that, in turn, allows tor targeted feedback, and then the feedback guides further practice. Goals can direct the nature of focused practice, provide the basis for evaluating observed performance, and shape the targeted feedback that guides future efforts.

Learning and performance are best fostered when people engage in practice that (a) focuses on a specific goal or criterion on performance, (b) targets an appropriate level of challenge relative to current performance, and (c) is of sufficient quantity and frequency to meet the performance criteria.

The amount of time someone spends in deliberate practice is what predicts continued learning in a given field, rather than time spent in generic practice. Goals provide people with a focus for their learning, which leads to more time and energy going to that area of focus. 

When people do not clearly articulate their goals, it is difficult to know what (or how) to practice. Giving people the goal of “understanding a key concept” tells rather little about the nature or level of understanding. In contrast, the goal of “recognizing when a key concept is at issue” or “explaining the key concept to a particular” or “applying the key concept to solve problems” are more concrete and directive. Clearly specified performance criteria can help direct people’s practice and their learning. 

Even if people have engaged in high-quality practice, they still need a sufficient quantity of practice [referred to as time on task] for the benefits to accumulate. People underestimate the need for practice. People often assume that when they can perform a task on one occasion in one context, their knowledge is secure when, in fact, it is much more difficult.

Goal directed practice must be coordinated with targeted feedback in order to promote the greatest learning gains. Effective feedback provides information about a learner’s current state of knowledge and performance that can guide him or her in working toward the learning goal. Effective feedback can tell people what they are or are not understanding, where their performance is going well or poorly, and how they should direct their subsequent efforts. 

Research points to two features of feedback that make people's learning more effective and efficient: content and timing. First, feedback should communicate to people where they are relative to the stated goal and what they need to do to improve. Second, feedback should provide this information when people can make the most use of it, based on the learning goals and structure of activities.


Strategies address the need for goal-directed practice:

* Conduct a prior knowledge assessment to target an appropriate challenge level

* Be more explicit about your goals

* Use a rubric to specify and communicate performance criteria

* Build in multiple opportunities for practice

* Set expectations about practice

* Give examples or models of target performance

* Refine your goals and performance criteria as the course progresses
