# Balanced scorecard

The balanced scorecard is a strategy performance management tool. It is a semi-standard structured report that can be used by managers to keep track of the execution of activities by the staff within their control and to monitor the consequences arising from these actions.

Balanced scorecard designs start with a "four perspective" approach to identify what measures to use to track the implementation of strategy:

  * Financial: encourages the identification of a few relevant high-level financial measures. In particular, designers were encouraged to choose measures that helped inform the answer to the question "How do we look to shareholders?" Examples: cash flow, sales growth, operating income, return on equity.

  * Customer: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What is important to our customers and stakeholders?" Examples: percent of sales from new products, on time delivery, share of important customersâ€™ purchases, ranking by important customers.

  * Internal business processes: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "What must we excel at?" Examples: cycle time, unit cost, yield, new product introductions.

  * Learning and growth: encourages the identification of measures that answer the question "How can we continue to improve, create value and innovate?". Examples: time to develop new generation of products, life cycle to product maturity, time to market versus competition.

Some designs give more relevance and functionality to strategic objectives. The major difference is the incorporation of Destination Statements. Other key components are strategic objectives, strategic linkage model and perspectives, measures and initiatives.

The critical characteristics that define a balanced scorecard are:

  * its focus on the strategic agenda of the organization concerned.

  * the selection of a small number of data items to monitor.

  * a mix of financial and non-financial data items.

Design of a balanced scorecard is about the identification of a small number of financial and non-financial measures and attaching targets to them, so that when they are reviewed it is possible to determine whether current performance 'meets expectations'. By alerting managers to areas where performance deviates from expectations, they can be encouraged to focus their attention on these areas, and hopefully as a result trigger improved performance within the part of the organization they lead.

The four steps required to design a balanced scorecard included in Kaplan & Norton's writing on the subject in the late 1990s:

  * Translating the vision into operational goals.

  * Communicating the vision and link it to individual performance.

  * Business planning; index setting.

  * Feedback and learning, and adjusting the strategy accordingly.
