# Practice and feedback

([Source](https://elearningindustry.com/deeper-learning-why-practice-feedback))

Practice is where we apply what we are learning. It’s where people make it meaningful and take it from what to how. Realistic practice makes learning easier to remember and apply for the job. Think about something you learned and applied to something important to you. What lessons did you learn? 

Feedback supplies information about needed changes. Feedback can come from many sources. If we are in a training class, feedback often comes from peers and the facilitator. We consider what others say about our answers and performance extrinsic—or external—feedback. We also get extrinsic feedback when we do an online activity and the screen tells us our answer was incorrect—and why.


## Learning in organzations

How can we decide what practice we should create, and what feedback we should use to evaluate it? When learning in organizations, desired work performance directs needed learning objectives. Learning objectives target needed practice and guide evaluation of the practice via feedback. 

If a learning objective doesn’t easily tell you what practice activity is needed, chances are the learning objective doesn’t describe specific work performance

Research on practice and feedback says that connecting the right kinds of practice with valuable feedback makes a significant difference in learning outcomes. I


## Learning and Performance

Learning and performance outcomes depend a LOT on what we know. When we have more knowledge, we can use it to analyze differences and make decisions. Without it, we struggle with the information presented. Learning is slower. People tend to give up easily when they are confused and can’t make sense of the information. 

I’ve had people tell me that we don’t need to remember anything; we can simply look things up when we need to. Sure, we can look up things. But having more knowledge helps us know what to look up, understand what we look up, and put it to use. Without that, we struggle.


## Building The Foundation

How do we build foundational knowledge? Research clearly shows that we make it easier to learn when we meet the specific (and often different) needs of different audiences. For those new to the topic, we intentionally and carefully determine the terms and concepts they need to build a foundation for further learning.

Learning for application is like building a house. It is built on a foundation, from the bottom up, with multiple levels. First, we learn facts and concepts (the "remember" level). Second, we build understanding around these facts and concepts (the "understand" level). Third, we build on understanding so we can take action (the "apply" level).
