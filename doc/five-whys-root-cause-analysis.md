# Five whys (5 whys) root cause analysis

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_whys

Five whys (or 5 whys) asks "Why did this happen?" five times, as a technique to solve problems. The idea is to determine the cause of a problem by repeating the question "Why?". Each answer forms the basis of the next question. The "five" in the name derives from an anecdotal observation on the number of steps needed to find a high quality answer.

A problem may have multiple root causes. To handle this, repeat the five whys method, asking a different sequence of questions each time.

The outcome depends upon the knowledge and persistence of the people involved. Therefore the process must include the customer's point of view, and also must engage with management.


## Rules

Rules:

* Assess processes, not people; never leave human error as the root cause.
* Write down all the information; verify that all participants understand.
* Base statements on facts, knowledge, and evidence.

Investigation:

* Distinguish causes, effects, symptoms, detections, triggers, and treatments.
* Ensure that causes certainly lead to the mistake by reversing the analysis.
* Try to make answers more precise and also inclusive of more perspectives.

Roles and responsbilities:

* Voice-of-customer: ensure all information has the customer perspective.
* Facilitator: seek information and participation while being neutral.
* Investigator: follow up on any missing information then report back.

Ground rules:

* Foster trust not blame.
* Foster sincerity not secrecy.
* Foster teamwork not individualism.
