# Investment readiness level

Investment readiness levels (IRL) are a method of estimating startup maturity, in terms of orienting toward fundraising via venture capital.

  * Level 1 - Basic principles observed and reported

  * Level 2 - Market size and competitive analysis

  * Level 3 - Validate problem/solution

  * Level 4 - Prototype low-fidelity minimum viable product (lo-fi MVP)

  * Level 5 - Validate product/market fit

  * Level 6 - Validate right side of business model canvas

  * Level 7 - Prototype high-fidelity MVP (hi-fi MVP)

  * Level 8 - Validate left side of business model canvas

  * Level 9 - Validate metrics that matter


## Focus on evidence and trajectory

Investors sitting through pitches used to have three metrics to judge fledgling startups: a PowerPoint presentation, a short demo, and the team's people. The lesson we learned over time: it's not clear there's a correlation between those metrics and building a successful business. 

Now, we focus on evidence and trajectory across the business model. A team proves their competence by validating that thereâ€™s a repeatable and scalable business model. The data gathered generates an Investment Readiness Level score.


## Uses

Among the advantages of readiness levels:

  * Provides a common understanding of preparedness status

  * Risk management

  * Used to make decisions concerning funding

  * Used to make decisions concerning transition of objectives

Some of the characteristics of readiness levels that limit their utility:

  * Readiness does not necessarily fit with appropriateness or maturity

  * A project may possess a greater or lesser degree of readiness for use, depending on context(s).

  * Numerous factors must be considered, including the relevances depending on environment(s)
