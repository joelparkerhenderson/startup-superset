# EBFAS organizational climate


"EBFAS" is a German acronym describing elements of organizational climate: Einheit (oneness), Behendigkeit (agility), Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling), Auftragstaktik (task tactic), Schwerpunkt (main point).


## Einheit (oneness)


Einheit: Literally "one-ness" or "unity". Can mean "a military detachment or unit". A common outlook possessed by "a body of officers" represents a unifying theme that can be used to simultaneously encourage subordinate initiative yet realize superior intent. TODO: Create Wikipedia entry.


## Behendigkeit (agility)


Behendigkeit: Literally "agility", nimbleness, quickness, swiftness. Behendigkeit, the way Boyd used it, is the ability to break out of longstanding patterns, even if they have been successful.


## Fingerspitzengefühl (fingertip feeling)


[Fingerspitzengefühl](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fingerspitzengef%C3%BChl): literally "fingertip feeling". Means intuitive flair or instinct, which has been adopted by the English language as a loanword. It describes a great situational awareness, and the ability to respond most appropriately and tactfully. It can also be applied to diplomats, bearers of bad news, sports players, or to describe a superior ability to respond to an escalated situation. 


## Auftragstaktik (task tactic)


[Auftragstaktik](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auftragstaktik): a form of military tactics where the emphasis is on the outcome of a mission rather than the specific means of achieving it. Mission-type tactics have been a central component of military tactics since the 19th century. The term Auftragstaktik was coined by opponents of the development of mission-type tactics. Opponents of the implementation of mission-type tactics were called Normaltaktiker.


## Schwerpunkt (main point)


[Schwerpunkt](https://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerpunkt): literally "hard, difficult, heavy" point. Usually: center of gravity, focus of main effort, focus and direction. heuristic device (conceptual tool or thinking formula) to make decisions from tactics to strategy about priority. Schwerpunkt has been translated as centre of gravity, crucial, focal point and point of main effort. None of these forms is sufficient to describe the universal importance of the term and the concept of Schwerpunktprinzip. Every unit in the army, from the company to the supreme command, decided on a Schwerpunkt through schwerpunktbildung, as did the support services, which meant that commanders always knew what was most important and why.
