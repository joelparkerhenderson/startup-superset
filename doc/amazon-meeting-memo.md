# Amazon meeting memo

Amazon meetings begin with everyone reading a six-page memo, for as long as 30 minutes, in total silence. The pages have writing on both sides, so people are reading 12 pages worth of text. Many of the memos contain an internal press release at the beginning of the memo, to provide a high-level understanding of the product or service or concept that is being proposed and discussed.

Reading together in the meeting guarantees everyone’s undivided attention to the issues at hand, but the real magic happens before the meeting ever starts. It happens when the author is writing the memo.

By having to write it all down — as opposed to dashing off quick bullet points or cobbling together powerpoint slides — authors are forced to think out tough questions and formulate clear, persuasive replies, all while reasoning through the structure and logic.


## Narrative 

The narrative has four main elements:

1) The context or question; the point or the objective.

2) Approaches to answer the question – by whom, by which method, and their conclusions; how teams have attempted to handle this issue in the past.

3) How is your attempt at answering the question different or the same from previous approaches?

4) Who cares and now what? What’s in it for the customer and the company? How does the answer to the question enable innovation on behalf of the customer?


## Press release outline example

**Heading**: Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

**Sub-Heading**: Describe the market (i.e. who wants your idea, and what benefit they get). One sentence only underneath the title.

**Summary**: Assume the reader will not read anything else, so this paragraph is critical. Note: If you struggle writing the summary, step back and reevaluate the idea.

**Problem**: Describe the problem your product solves. Be clear.

**Solution**:  Describe how your product solves the problem. Be enthusiastic!

**Spokesperson quotation**: A motivational quotation from a spokesperson in your company.

**How to start** : Describe how easy it is for customers to get started using the service.

**Customer quotation**: A quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experience the benefit.

**Call to action**: Reinforce to the customer why the offering is must-have, and reinforce the ease, value, benefit, and how to start.


## Explanations by CEO Jeff Bezos

"The narrative structure of a good memo forces better thought and better understanding of what’s more important than what.”

"The great memos are written and rewritten, shared with colleagues who are asked to improve the work, set aside for a couple of days, and then edited again with a fresh mind.” 

“The key point here is that you can improve results through the simple act of teaching scope – that a great memo probably should take a week or more.”
