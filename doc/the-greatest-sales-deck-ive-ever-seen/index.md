The greatest sales deck is a narrative with 5 steps: a major shift, a critical competition, a new Promised Land, magic gifts, and proof of leadership.

To be the most successful, the entire organization must align around the narrative.


### 1. Name the major shift in the world

Don't kick off a sales presentation by talking about your product, your headquarters locations, your investors, your clients, or anything about yourself. 

Instead, name the undeniable shift in the world that creates both (a) big stakes and (b) huge urgency for your prospect.

You want prospects to open up about how that shift affects them, how it scares them, and where they see opportunities.


### 2. Describe thecritical competition of winners and losers

All prospects suffer from what economists call “loss aversion.” That is, they tend to avoid a possible loss by sticking to the status quo, rather than risk a possible gain by opting for change. 

You must demonstrate how the change you cited above will create big winners and big losers. In other words, you have to show both (a) adapting to the change you cited will likely result in a highly positive future for winners and (b) not adapting will likely result in an unacceptably negative future for losers.


### 3. Tease a new Promised Land

Do not jump into the details of your product or service, because prospects won’t yet have enough context and they’ll tune out. 

Instead, present a “teaser” vision of a new Promised Land, which is a new future state -- a happily-ever-after for your prospect and the winners.

Your Promised Land is desirable (obviously) yet difficult for the prospect to achieve without outside help.

Your Promised Land is crucial for helping prospects pitch your solution to colleagues after your sales meeting ends. In your absence, those colleagues will ask, “What do those guys do again?” Armed with a compelling Promised Land, your prospects are more likely to supply an answer that gets others on board. 


### 4. Introduce features as “magic gifts”

Successful sales decks follow the same narrative structure as epic films and fairy tales. 

When you introduce your product or service, do so by positioning its capabilities as “magic gifts” for helping the main character (your prospect) reach The Promised Land. 

The magic gifts are the foundation for an engaging conversation with prospects about why it’s so hard to reach The Promised Land with traditional solutions. 


### 5. Prove you can lead the prospect to the Promised Land

The road to The Promised Land is, by definition, littered with obstacles, so prospects are rightly skeptical.

So you provide the best evidence you can that you can deliver success: (a) use a success story about how you’ve already helped someone else who is similar to the prospect, (b) use testimonials, (c) use product demos that are in the context of reaching The Promised Land.
