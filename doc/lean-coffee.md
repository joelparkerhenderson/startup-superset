# Lean coffee

Lean coffee is a lightweight way to work together on topics.

To begin a Lean Coffee:

  * Participants think of topics relevant to the meeting theme.

  * Parcipants write each topic on a sticky note.

  * Do this for at least a few minutes, and until peopple run out of topic ideas.

Share and triage:

  * Each participant briefly describes their topics to the whole group.

  * Then, everyone uses dots to show interest in a few topics.

  * Someone arranges the sticky notes according to the number of dots.

Work:

  * The group begins discussing the highest priority topic.

  * The facilitator, or a volunteer, keeps time. 

  * Each topic gets a time box, typically five minutes.

When time is up, the group uses thumb voting.

  * Thumb up means you want to continue with the topic for a few minutes longer.

  * Thumb down means you want to move on to a new topic.

  * Thumb sideways means you are neutral and will do whatever the rest of the group wants.
