# The Four Steps to the Epiphany - Customer Development

The Customer Development model of a startup starts with a simple premise: learning and discovering who a company’s initial customers will be, and what markets they are in, requires a
separate and distinct process from product development.

Before any of the traditional functions of selling and marketing can happen, a startup must prove that a market can exist, and verify that someone will pay real dollars for the solutions the startup envisions. The testing, learning, and discovery activities are at the heart of what makes a startup unique, and they are what make Customer Development so different from the product development process. 


## The four steps

  * **Customer Development**: focuses on understanding customer problems and needs

  * **Customer Validation**: focuses on developing a sales model that can be replicated

  * **Customer Creation**: focuses on creating and driving end user demand

  * **Company Building**: focuses on transitioning from discovery to execution


## Screw it up

Each step in Customer Development is iterative. That’s a polite way of saying, “Unlike product development, finding the right customers and market is unpredictable, and we will
screw it up several times before we get it right.”  

It's worth pondering this for a moment, because this philosophy of “It’s OK to screw it up if you plan to learn from it” is the heart of the methodology.


## Customer Development + Product Development

Customer Development and Product Development are parallel processes. 

The Customer Development group is engaged in customer-centric activities outside the building, and the Product Development group is focused on the product-centric activities that are taking place internally. For a startup to succeed, Customer Development and Product Development must remain synchronized and operate in concert.

Features emerge by vision and fiat against unknown unknown market requirements and customer requirements. As the market and customers get clearer, by successive refinement, features are driven by how well they satisfy this market and these customers. 

The processes have one overarching goal: proving that there is a profitable, scalable business for the company.
