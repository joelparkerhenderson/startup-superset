# Customer Development Manifesto

The Customer Development Manifesto is from The Startup Ownerâ€™s Manual, by Steve Blank and Bob Dorf.

  * There Are No Facts Inside Your Building, So Get Outside

  * Pair Customer Development with Agile Development

  * Failure is an Integral Part of the Search

  * Make Continuous Iterations and Pivots

  * No Business Plan Survives First Contact with Customers So Use a Business Model Canvas

  * Design Experiments and Test to Validate Your Hypothesis

  * Agree on Market Type. It Changes Everything

  * Startup Metrics Differ from Those in Existing Companies

  * Fast Decision-Making, Cycle Time, Speed and Tempo

  * It's All About Passion

  * Startup Job Titles Are Very Different from a Large Company's

  * Preserve All Cash Until Needed. Then Spend.

  * Communicate and Share Learning

  * Customer Development Success Begins With Buy-In
