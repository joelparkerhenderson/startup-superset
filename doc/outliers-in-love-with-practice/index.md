# Outliers: in love with practice

([Source](http://wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/))


## Falling in Love With Practice

The elite don’t just work harder than everybody else; the elites fall in love with practice.

The elite software developer is the programmer who spends all day pounding code at work, and after leaving work she writes open source software on her own time.

The elite football player is the guy who spends all day on the practice field with his teammates, and after practice he goes home to watch game films.

The elite physician listens to medical podcasts in the car during a long commute, and travels to training conferences on the weekends.

The elites are in love with what they do, and at some point it no longer feels like work.


## What’s Next?

Now that we’ve reviewed the trends uncovered by Outliers, what can we do about it? All of us want to be great at something. Now that we know how other achievers have gotten there, what can we do to join their ranks?

One approach: We could choose a field and practice for 10,000 hours. If we are currently working in our target profession, forty hours per week over five years would give us ten thousand hours.

Or… We can look at the question in reverse. Where have we already logged 10,000 hours of practice? What is it that we do really well? What tasks do we perform so well that people ask: How did you do that? Sometimes when we fall in love with practice we don’t even recognize it!

Practice plays a major role in success. If you’re running a company, how do you create an environment that gives everyone on your team the opportunity to practice?
