# Minimum viable product

A minimum viable product (MVP) is a product with just enough features to satisfy early customers, and to provide feedback for future product development.

Gathering insights from an MVP is often less expensive than developing a product with more features, which increases costs and risk if the product fails, for example, due to incorrect assumptions. The MVP may also involve carrying out market analysis beforehand.

A minimum viable product has just enough core features to effectively deploy the product, and no more. Developers typically deploy the product to a subset of possible customersâ€”such as early adopters thought to be more forgiving, more likely to give feedback, and able to grasp a product vision from an early prototype or marketing information. This strategy targets avoiding building products that customers do not want and seeks to maximize information about the customer per amount of money spent.

The minimum viable product is that version of a new product a team uses to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort. It requires judgement to figure out, for any given context, what MVP makes sense. Due to this vagueness, the term MVP is commonly used, either deliberately or unwittingly, to refer to a much broader notion ranging from a rather prototype-like product to a fully-fledged and marketable product.[8]

An MVP can be part of a strategy and process directed toward making and selling a product to customers. An MVP is a core artifact in an iterative process of idea generation, prototyping, presentation, data collection, analysis and learning. One seeks to minimize the total time spent on an iteration. The process is iterated until a desirable product/market fit is obtained, or until the product is deemed non-viable.

MVP purposes:

  * Accelerate learning

  * Test a product hypothesis with minimal resources

  * Reduce wasted engineering hours

  * Get the product to early customers as soon as possible

  * Create a base for other products

  * Establish a builder's abilities in crafting the product required

  * Brand building very quickly


The MVP differs from the conventional market testing strategy of investing time and money early to implement a product before testing it in the market. The MVP is intended to ensure that the market wants the product before large time and monetary investments are made. 

The MVP starts with a product vision, which is maintained throughout the product life cycle, although it is adapted based on the explicit and implicit (indirect measures) feedback from potential future customers of the product.

Presentation of non-existing products and features may be refined using web-based statistical hypothesis testing, such as A/B testing.
