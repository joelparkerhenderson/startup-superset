# Crossing the Chasm

Crossing the Chasm is a book that focuses on marketing high tech products during the early start up period. Tom Byers, director of the Stanford Technology Ventures Program, described it as "still the bible for entrepreneurial marketing 15 years later".

Crossing the Chasm begins with the diffusion of innovations theory, and argues there is a chasm between the early adopters of the product (the technology enthusiasts and visionaries) and the early majority (the pragmatists). The book believes visionaries and pragmatists have very different expectations, and he attempts to explore those differences and suggest techniques to successfully cross the "chasm," including choosing a target market, understanding the whole product concept, positioning the product, building a marketing strategy, choosing the most appropriate distribution channel and pricing.


## Technology adoption lifecycle

Crossing the Chasm is closely related to the technology adoption lifecycle, where five main segments are recognized: innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority, laggards.


## Beachhead and bowling pins

According to the book, the marketer should focus on one group of customers at a time, using each group as a base for marketing to the next group. One analogy is establishing beachhead, then going deeper into an area. Another analogy is targeting one bowling pin, to use it to knock over the next bowling pin.

The most difficult step is making the transition between visionaries (early adopters) and pragmatists (early majority). This is the chasm that the book refers to. 

If a successful firm can create a bandwagon effect in which enough momentum builds, then the product becomes a de facto standard. 


## Pre-chasm

Pre-chasm, in technology entrepreneurship, describes the phase prior to Crossing the Chasm that focuses on the specifics of marketing high-tech products during the early start-up period. Pre-chasm was suggested as an extension to Moore's model, arguing that the phase prior to the "chasm" is left unintended and that it, driven by technology commoditization and lean startup principles, requires an ambidextrous approach to product development alongside marketing to achieve product-market fit.
