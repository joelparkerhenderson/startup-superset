**The degree to which you're successful** is the degree to which your product is so good that people spontaneously tell others. There is no other secret to success.  This is it. It's really hard to do.

**Look for a market** that is starting to undergo exponential growth. Most successful startups start in small markets that are growing very quickly. Identify a market that's set to grow, then ride the elevator up.

**A startup's advantage is in agility and speed.** The more a market is changing, the higher the number of decisions you get to make, and the more agile you can be in comparison to existing companies.  If your market is evolving quickly, then your advantages can compound over those of established players.

**Successful startups** are usually started by a founder with a confident and definite view of the future.  Even if you're wrong, flexible confidence of a clearly articulated future tends to correlate to success.

**It's very hard to succeed** without some kind of a chief evangelist who's emotionally invested in the mission and infects the world. An ambitious vision helps with this.  Being grandiose turns people off, but you want to let yourself grow more ambitious over time.  Ambitious visions are fun to work on!  They're interesting. Picking something that matters is a great way to attract people towards an ambitious vision.

**When you're starting,** make sure that it's something that a lot of people will want to contribute to and associate with.  Getting mindshare is really hard.  People are interested in startups that matter.

**The startup ecosystem is best set up** to support companies that have a low chance of success but are huge if they work.  Going for something that's huge if it works will attract the best people.

**Optimism is important.**  The world will tell you why you'll fail, but if you don't have the internal fire of belief and people around you saying "we're going to figure this out", then it's very hard to succeed.

**In terms of team,** you obviously need smart people who work really hard and communicate well.  The team you build is the company you build.  Spend enough time recruiting.  When you switch from building a product to building a company, you shift towards assembling a team.

**"We'll figure it out" is important, and so is "I'll do it".** You want people who bias towards action, who move very quickly, who act with much less data than they want to have. If something doesn't work, adapt quickly and try something else.

**Idea people are important.** You don't want too many, because then you'll have more ideas than you can follow through on, but having people who throw out ideas (even if most are bad) is very very important.

**Startups survive on their own momentum.** One of the most important jobs you have as a founder is momentum.  For the first few years, you never get to rest.  If you lose momentum, it's very difficult to get it back.  Recurring victories are very important.

**Startups need a competitive advantage.** A network effect.  Monopoly potential. You don't need to have the business model figured out at the beginning, but you should have some kind of sensible business model articulated. You need a distribution strategy.  

**Work on ideas that sound bad but are actually good.** You'll have an advantage over your existing competitors because in any established company, there's a hierarchy and one single "no" can destroy an idea.  With a startup, you don't need to convince a hierarchy - you can just do the thing.

**The traits of the best founders** include Frugality, Focus, Obsession, and Love.
