# Drucker teamwork exercise

The Drucker teamwork exercise helps teammates understand each others' strengths, performance, values, and expectations.


## Strengths: what am I good at?

  * Understanding your core strengths is good to two reasons. First, it raises your level of self awareness (necessary for spotting opportunities where you can really shine). Second, it tells others where they can expect you to excel.

  * Write down the expected outcomes of your critical decisions. And check the same every year. While analyzing, one will be able to understand their strengths, incompetence and the hindrances that may affect the strengths.


## Performance: how do I work best?

  * Example: Are you a morning person? Let them know, so they will schedule meetings with you during your most productive hours.

  * Example: Do you enjoy collaborating, and also work well using stretches of solitude? Let them know, so they will understand when you grab your laptop and head down to the coffee shop for some private brain storming.


## Values: what do I stand for?

  * There are stake in the ground that let’s people know what’s important to you and what you care deeply about.

  * This gives your team insight into what they can expect from you, and better predict how you are going to act and behave.

  * These can be tested using what Drucker refers as “Mirror Test”, i.e. What kind of person you want to see in the mirror.


## Expectations: what will I do?

  * What does the situation require?

  * Given my strengths, my way of performing, and my values, how can I make the greatest contribution to what needs to be done?

  * What results have to be achieved to make a difference?

  * What can the team expect from you on this project?

  * This question really gets into what role(s) you can be expected to play on the project.
