## Comparisons

Perseverance: the steadfast pursuit of a task, mission, or journey in spite of obstacles, discouragement, or distraction. Grit is a trait of perseverance. Grit adds a component of passion for the goal, and this passion also contributes to the ability of to sustain effort over the long term.

Hardiness: a combination of attitudes that provide the courage and motivation to do the difficult strategic work of turning stressful circumstances from potential disasters into growth opportunities. Hardiness refers to an individual's ability to persist through difficult circumstances, whereas grit also addresses the individual's long term persistence toward a specific goal.

Resilience: a dynamic process in which an individual overcomes significant adversity, usually as an adaptive repsponse to the form of a life changing event. Grit does not require a critical incident. Grit is conceptualized as a trait while resilience is a dynamic process.

Ambition: broadly, the desire for attainment, power, fame, or superiority. In contrast to ambition, grit is not associated with seeking fame or external recognition for achievements. Gritty individuals do not seek to distinguish themselves from other people, but to obtain personal goals.

Self-control: the ability to manage one's emotions and behavior in the face of temptations and impulses. Self-control entails aligning actions with any valued goal despite momentarily more-alluring alternatives. Grit, in contrast, entails working assiduously toward a single challenging superordinate goal through thick and thin, on a timescale of years.

Need for achievement: a drive to complete manageable goals that enable the individual to receive immediate feedback. In contrast to need for achievement, gritty individuals consciously set long-term goals that are difficult to attain and do not waver from these difficult goals, regardless of feedback.


## Grit and goals

Grit entails having a dominant superordinate goal and tenaciously working toward it in the face of obstacles and setbacks, often for years. Subordinate goals are tightly aligned with the superordinate goal and these lower-order goals in turn give rise to effective actions toward the superordinate goal.

Gritty individuals either are able to actively suppress rival superordinate goals or, consistent with descriptions of eminently productive individuals, lack competing superordinate goals altogether.

Gritty individuals, when faced with setbacks, to find a way forward by “sprouting” new subordinate goals (or actions) when a current subordinate goal (or action) is blocked. In a gritty individual’s domain of passionate interest, goals or actions deemed unfeasible are met with the response of an active search for—or even invention of—viable alternatives.
