# Liftoff: origins, outcomes, outputs

A liftoff is a team event that helps with starting a company or project, by gathering the teammates to define the intentions, approaches, and plans.

For example, a startup company team or enterprise project team can schedule a one-week liftoff event, such as an offsite get-together. The team uses the week to align, collaborate, and plan.
